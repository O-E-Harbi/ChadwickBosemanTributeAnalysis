0,"when i head the news that #chadwickboseman passed away. #memes #marvel #blackpanther #spongebobsquarepants #spongebobmemes @marvel @spongebob https://t.co/93ylqykqai @marvel im sure everyone is asking was there a black panther sequel in production before chadwick bosman passed away?  i write childrens books and have thought of options for the beginning of the next sequel.  question: will there be a release in the near future? @mcu_fanatics i would prefer that @marvel acknowledge t chala has passed and the next man up must go through the challenge ritual to earn the right to be king &amp; the new black panther, plus his death can be a mystery that needs solving @kevfeige @disneystudios @russo_brothers @disney hear me out. with the death of chadwick bosemen if you plan on keeping black panther dont just have a full length movie where he is cgi the whole time. no, you have it be known that tchalla had passed away, but shuri is next in line as ruler. as she is going through the @theblackpanther my sister passed away of cancer complications...this song is for you black panther rip.....
https://t.co/jd1q6zrlna @mspackyetti @disney @disneyplus black panther will air on @abcnetwork for the world to see along with a tribute. pass the info along @marvel the first superhero my son ever really knew was the #blackpanther. chadwick instantly made an impact on my son... today i had to tell him his hero passed away.
i then told him we were going to watch the black panther, in memory of chadwick... 1/2 way through i asked him why...  https://t.co/xl39xc6reb i don't think @marvelstudios should recast t'challa's black panther, but maybe they could acknowledge his death in the marvel universe and pass the black panther mantle on? this has happened in the comics a few times with jasper cole and his sister, shuri, for example. @theblackpanther we should keep black panther 2, he did it great helping black get representation on big screen, im sure he would like that somebody keep with his task. its sad he passed away but black community deserve get more representation with a proper black character. @hysyeyey @anarki1112 @dmcnairn76 @battinsonbatman @dccomics well, if we only consider character itself, it's meant to pass on just like superman, batman and spider-man. mr. boseman's accidentally passing away is very unfortunate, but black panther/t'challa still needs to live through generations to generations. .@disney @marvelstudios @waltdisneyco

https://t.co/mjks468jfj #chadwickforever #wakandaforever #chadwickbosemanforever #blackpanther @robertdowneyjr @chadwickboseman how sad that chadwick boseman passed away at 43 it is not fair i did not have the opportunity to meet him in person who rests in peace may rest in peace chadwick boseman balways remeber black panther it is always in my heart my feelings and my prayers for the boseman family  @paul_bettany how sad chadwick boseman passed away at 43 it is not fair i did not have the opportunity to meet him in person who rests in peace always remeber black panther always live her in my heart   @jeremyrenner how sad chadwick boseman passed away at 43 it is not fair i did not have the opportunity to meet him in person who rests in peace always remeber black panther always live her in my heart   this is roland williams. he was a huge marvel fan and he tragically passed away on feb 11th 2018. his final wish was to see black panther. @marvelstudios bought the movie to his home feb 1st. @chadwickboseman was his hero. chad meant so much to our culture. miss you ro.  https://t.co/sgyt1gvgmb @anarki1112 @dmcnairn76 @battinsonbatman @dccomics they will. maybe black panther 2 can delay its original schedule and let fans progress it, but black panther as a character, needs to pass on. just like when christopher reeve passed away, superman's legacy gave to brandon routh. #chadwickboseman passed away #ripchadwickboseman
chadwick was diagnosed with stage iii colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage iv. 

@marvelstudios 
@chadwickboseman  https://t.co/olsnvebymt mateo's favorite @marvel was black panther had to tell him this morning that he passed away so he says 
""he is a super hero he goes to super hero heaven and comes back when we need him"". it's truly saddening that #chadwickboseman passed away - really gutted. 

it's also saddening that the clickbait ""what can @marvelstudios do for black panther 2?"" articles have already begun showing up. #vultures

#wakandaforever #chadwickforever #chadwickbosemanrip omg i cant believe chadwick boseman has passed away man it was just the other day i remember waiting in line for the cinema to see black panther with my friends i hope chadwick bosemans family are okay and coping alright  @marvel @chadwickboseman #marvel #chadwickboseman @kevfeige @marvelstudios a request that t'challa not be replaced. let the black panther mantle be passed but let chad's character retire. i am sure that would be a worthy tribute. it's so sad to know that a great actor is already passed away

@marvelstudios @treasuremembers @chadwickboseman https://t.co/mk2v5j7ljp the @marvelstudios community just lost a great person, actor @chadwickboseman passed away at the age of 43 from a 4 year battle with colon cancer. 

#blackpanther #chadwickboseman #wakandaforever #rip @mcu_fanatics no, black panther should be allowed to pass on with the actor. @marvelstudios i still can't believe that chadwick bosemen had passed away. the question that still fills my head is, as the king has gone to heaven, will shuri be crowned queen of wakanda in black panther 2? how will t'challa be cut out in a way to honor his character? @casademayor @theblackpanther i just think that for now, it would be a nice tribute to chadwick not to recast t'challa. the black panther mantle can pass to shuri.  at a later stage in the future if marvel wishes they can then recast the part. @disney pls dont with black panther the same way you did when carrie fisher passed away. there was no need for leia to die in the story. make a lovely tribute for chadwick. show us a wakandan funeral. and crown shuri as queen and black panther. its not that hard. remembered-actor #chadwickboseman has passed at 43.accomplishing more in a few years than some actors are able to in an entire career,boseman's immense talent shined through early &amp; came to fruition in defining roles like #jackierobinson,#jamesbrown,&amp;,of course,@theblackpanther. https://t.co/kjaefpzjov @wick014 @marvelstudios it would be so devastating to have tchalla die in infinity war, come back to his family, and then pass away again @marvelstudios any other black panther actor should be black, and someone unknown, showing in the movie how he passed on n hand over his crown to maybe his son to protect wakanda or help in time of crisis.. and don't use any white person or big hollywood name to play that character in respect @thatashleyerin @mikeyuan82 @whiskynsunshine my biological father died from colon cancer so i know what it does
my moms (who passed) loved 42
reading and hearing what the film black panther meant to so many people (and for representation)
to know he persevered through all of it to make tchalla come to life ...
so heroic! @attorneycherika @marcwatkinsesq black panther didnt die the actor that played him passed i cant tell you how to interact with your child but the character that he loves still lives he can continue to watch the movies and continue to be inspired @marvelstudios some of you dont understand what i mean. retire tchalla. black panther (the hero title) can (and should) be passed on to tchallas sister shuri. but no other actor should play tchalla out of respect. at least not in this continuity of the franchise. @jazzlandia_ @marvelstudios i'd like to see marvel honour chadwick by giving t'challa a funeral and pass the mantel of black panther to a young black actor and not recast t'challa. don't want another fast fiasco. @theblackpanther rip... for the people saying dont make black panther 2 and scrap the whole thing out of respect, i mean i didnt hear people say scrap batman when heath ledger passed, id imagine chadwick would want his legacy to carry on, pave the way for another actor to carry the mantle.. @alizasoto2 @acm_1030 @theblackpanther no do not retire the character. black panther is iconic and can be played with a new actor. representation matters even tho he passed. white people already are trying to use this as an excuse smh @marvelstudios #tragic that a great actor has passed  #wakandaforver  thank you #chadwickboseman https://t.co/g02jv20q0a then tragedy struck when the lead of the black panther franchise chadwick boseman passed away. marvel studios @kevfeige had this to say. https://t.co/vdzybuzqob @edzofpain @wakristina @marvel @theblackpanther ya its so much they fault he passed away. @marvel @theblackpanther @marvelstudios @kevfeige @theblackpanther you all are a bunch of hypocrites. youll recast t. ross but wont #recasttchalla ? ill pass on seeing this film . #honorchadwickboseman #blackpanther #wakandaforever https://t.co/pi35yf0yos @atlblerd2 @marvel @marvelstudios quick question had chadwick not passed away and marvel still was not giving bp a 3 movie arc what would the hashtag be instead of recast tchalla? @igwejimmiri @justjuneseighty not to mention the main featured hulk has been recasted. plus it puts @kevfeige and marvel in a negative light because their whole reasoning for not recasting is because the actor passed away. so why is it ok for one role and not the other? @lordchickenhawk @memo33x_ @marvelstudios chadwick boseman was still alive to film those scenes. he passed away before black panther 2 entered production, that's why this new movie is about his character being done with. i'm not going to waste time arguing with a fake fan-bot, but your takes are really bad for a fake acc @marvelstudios @marvel  stop making nonsense's movie and series, we knew that....#stanlee has pass away and you don't have ability make movies. me: oh, all out avengers sounds interesting... 

*checks preview*... 

oh. greg land.  and he's still plagiarizing ""art references"".

*puts away credit card* i'll pass.

even ignoring that, his ""style"" is best suited for romance novel covers or soft core porn. 

why @marvel ? https://t.co/hlqpd1rpq7 @fatherof1234 @disney @marvelstudios no, no it's not! when chadwick passed away marvel studios head kevin feige set the precedent no recast in the wake of an actors death, and here the mcu is recasting thadious thunderbolt ross with harrison ford for the thunderbolts movie, where the honor in that? ngl i relly hate the fact that because chadwick passed away that @marvel decided to end the black panther we don't wanna see a t'challa funeral find a replacement. cc: @marvel @kevfeige 

what is up why kill off a legendary superhero because first actor passed away in real life? @philipdanso10 @marvel hope so. and yes the mantle is passed in the royal family, but based on the previous film anyone from the wakandan tribes can challenge for leadership and assume the mantle of bp, like mbaku tried and how killmonger succeeded. so it could be anyone strong enough. @theblackpanther i cannot fathom how people are asking why they didnt recast chadwick as black panther. are people living under a rock?? he passed away. long live the memory of the king @ws_wolfstar @marvel i mean, we saw him come back in endgame. but years have passed. they could make it that he died for any number of reasons. killed in action, an accident, or maybe an illness. death can come knocking at any time for anyone. @marvel gotta wonder how happy kevin feige was when he heard chadwick had passed? he could finaly replace him without any argument. he could use his death as marketing. exploting a dead man and pretend to care. this isn't even woke anymore. it's just disgusting. and yet, i'll get the . @mcu_direct this is insulting  #williamhurt was an amazing actor rip and he signed a 11 picture deal with marvel and they slept on him for years and now cause he passed you just wanna recast him!?! no way. he will always general ross @kevfeige @marvelstudios @marveluk @thedenofnerds well hurt's family gave marvel permission to recast soon after william passed away. either that conversation never happened with chadwick's family, or chadwick's family (for some reason) said no to a recast.

my bets are on that it's the former of the two. @marvelstudios no offense to feige, but did people forget that when the og actor of dumbledore passed, they recasted him?

i miss chadwick too, but there is a plethora of amazing black talent out there willing to take up the t'challa/black panther mantle. @bpanthernews nope. #blackpanther fans didnt ask 4 an immediate sequel. @kevfeige &amp; @marvelstudios announced a sequel 3 mos &amp; some days after #chadwickboseman passed. filming started in late june, less than a yr after he passed. this is nothing more than a money grab 2 capitalize off his death @marvel all these years charles always picked what was right over what is moral in some points he ordered his own brothers death , but i think charles needs a pass over not just because he fought for the mutant kind like no one did . @_chaitanyajoshi @kreadivd @mcu_direct nonsense. the character of t'challa is even more important. but both are necessary for either franchise. it would be as if daniel radcliffe passed away and suddenly hermione became the focus of the series. that's how much sense this wakanda forever makes. @spam58210495 @marvel a,recast can always be one option. if actor dies is a reason, superman has been dead last century with christopher reeve's pass. b, it's never hard to introduce new characters. mcu's norman osborn can exist. also, this team has cap, ant-man, widow's characters already @fantom_ph4ntom @marvel this has been planned out for months. no one knew the queen was gonna pass away today. it is sad that she passed away, yes, i completely agree, however, things cant just be changed on a whim like that man, its not even possible. @thedancingdog60 @edzofpain @dinkyscent @marvelstudios it's like when christopher reeves passed away do we have to lose superman? i think not. marvel studios need to separate the actor from the character @marvelstudios if you all really cared then you would have re-casted to continue telling the story of black panther like chadwick wanted... he didn't want a fictional character that was finally getting the spot light to be killed off because the actor tragically passed away... @theobutler04 @theblerdgurl #recasttchalla movement honor mr. chadwick boseman on the date that he passed away. 
marvel didn't post anything honor the man on that day. it's been 2 years ago since @chadwickboseman aka t'challa / the black panther had passed away on 8-28-2020 #ripchadwickboseman #wakandaforever https://t.co/42bydsujlp perhaps it's just my imagination, but i can't not see a palmer self-portrait as the black night in @marvel's avengers #273 || legendary inker (july 13, 1942 - aug 18, 2022) passed away yesterday at the age of 81. https://t.co/myuv6q1sga https://t.co/dxxjvaxmuc @emansreviews they are destroying the black panther film series on purpose. who says that about a billion dollar film? what company makes a billion dollars and says, lets not do that again. 
hard pass on black panther 2. @marvelheaux @ekie0 the narrative after chadwick's passing all of a sudden was his portrayal was iconic? that narrative is performative and a lie. they know it.  the mainstream discourse about the first black panther film that went on from 2018-2020 before he passed was always about t'challa being @gman62636 @emansreviews i wouldnt be hell bent on making wolverine 5ft3 if i were marvel . 5ft6 should be fine. like if theres the right actor thats around that height, then they shouldnt pass him over for not being 5ft3 @shehulkofficial @marvelstudios @disneyplus ill pass. you guys had a great run and made some great marvel movies however your last thor movie was completely inappropriate for my children. ive lost trust and confidence in disney to produce an age appropriate film for my children. @shehulkofficial cant even enjoy the new marvel movies. it went downhill really fast since stan lee passed away. real fans will agree @emansreviews has been money with it. hulk was recast, war machine was recast. chadwick passed away, t'challa didn't. they could have easily recast the role and did a major tribute to him in the post credits without doing a tradtional marvel credit. they killed him again it's been a few years since stan lee, creator of iconic marvel heroes passed away. however, his legacy continues to live through his work. @marvelstudios 

https://t.co/kg8hetketx stan lee would be very disappointed with @marvel if he seen what they have been doing since he passed .. they slowly tearing up his legacy @bobmarley @theblackpanther @temsbaby @marvel it is a shame they did away with a character, and i know it is sad to see chadwick pass. it is not honoring him in anyway to suddenly write off the actual black panther as dead. wtf?! @lowkilux @biorhythm_music @emansreviews @marvelstudios because when shuri got the powers tchalla never passed away he was battling internal conflict with himself and bast and left wakanda for self growth and to be a better person @bryancmiles @marvelstudios i understand that. chadwick bozeman made a huge impact on everyone who saw the first black panther movie and his cameos in other mcu movies. but it bothers me that they have to kill of the fictional character because the actor passed. @lowkilux @emansreviews @marvelstudios chad, himself, stated what his hope for the role was, so that certainly is what you're saying. albeit, indirectly.
imagine if c. evans passed away after the 1st cap film &amp; marvel decided to kill the character off.
so, you're also saying that t'challa's not an important character. @tonyapendleton @cami72441211 @emansreviews @marvelstudios also, imagine if chris evans passed away after the 1st cap film &amp; marvel decided to kill the character off in the mcu. ppl are essentially saying that t'challa's not an important lead character. which goes against the logic for why he's celebrated as being such an historic icon. @itzanimosity @jacob_c_gorham @guy_lnd you realize the storylines for each character portrayed by the actors you named, got to be fulfilled? imagine if chris passed away after the 1st cap film &amp; marvel decided to kill the character off in the mcu. you're essentially saying that t'challa's not an important character. @marvelheaux to the people who are downplaying the issue. folks had no problem recasting dumbledore after the original actor passed away so what's the bloody excuse to not re-cast tchalla?

https://t.co/2adj94gaww @emansreviews @vanlathan @chadwickboseman @marvelstudios recast the role. the black panther is a fictional character played by a real person who passed away. morn chadwick in the real world and move on in the fictional one. we make things so complicated. so.. some @marvelstudios fans want 2 boycott #wakandaforever saying it ""killed off"" the black panther, and started a #recasttchalla campaign. people, when chadwick sadly passed in 2020, director ryan coogler said he ""would not recast""! but the black panther is still in the film. @theartjedi @marvel ok this is gonna sound weird but your work heavily reminds me of my uncle 

he drew as a hobby and for a brief time owned a comic shop he's the reason i'm even into superheros to begin with his art looks very similar to yours 

he passed away last year @marvelstudios if this movie is as racist as the last black panther film i will take a hard pass. no thanks. @bustdownkms @andrepharr @theblackpanther have you guys even bothered to watch the trailer lol. its made clear that he has passed away in the trailer  and that there is going to be a new black panther @marvelstudios literally cant wait for this. recent mcu films have honestly been shite. so much that can be done with black panther. looks amazing and should be a fitting tribute as the torch is passed. @starlessone @marvel they could always pass the mantle. they shouldnt do an abrupt and blatant recast though, as the actor is what added to tchallas appeal. @marvel shoulda recast tchalla and dedicated the movie to chadwick. there was so much more story to tell with the character instead of using the actors death. now youll shoehorn shuri as the lead when it should be okoye if anyone bc shes the strongest fighter who could pass the trials. @pafmer4 @marvel yea, i mean sometimes you have to figure things out when you know... actors pass away? @moonguy26 @marvelstudios @theblackpanther .. you do know there are multiple black panthers right? it's more of a mantle people carry, his father was shown to be the black panther in the first movie, and i think in the comics it's passed off to shuri, so i imagine she'll take up the title in this film @marvel don't like this 
also i don't understand, when they were postpone the movie did he not act little before he pass away y'all should respect him with this movie not buy showing his pic  when paul walker pass ff still keep him in the movie they never cast him out. @chiefwakil sad part is the movie is probably gonna be . but it doesnt sit right with me that marvel is killing off a strong black male leader and role model in order to honor the death of a strong black male leader and role model. no more black death! ill pass. @emansreviews @ekie0 @marvelstudios this sh** is disgusting! screw marvel and this film. no way im gonna feel his death twice. i didnt even know the man and his passing touched me. nope. hard pass. they should have recast and kept telling tchallas story. @marvel really would like to see red hulk i know the actor passed but you can still do red hulk he doesnt revert back and forth like bruce banner does. he enjoys the power it gives him so you can do that with a voice actor taking the reigns @marvel so damn excited for the second one omg still sad that chad isnt playing him cause he passed away but i hope who ever is black panther in this one can live up to chad boswells legacy @massivemonolith @marvelstudios i just feel like recasting a character thats face is already known to the mcu and whos actor sadly passed away would feel wrong, not saying that there shouldnt be another black panther but having another tchalla would feel less genuine than passing on the mantle @adamchecknight @marvelstudios @theblackpanther i totally agree rip chadwick of course but they cant just kill the character off because he passed in real life bad move by marvel @fineasscj this isnt following comics tchalla never passed away @marvel are we starting the movie off with a funeral? we need to honor chadwick, and not hide behind a story. its ok to say he passed from cancer. the fans will understand. #wakandaforever #rip @amanjyotsingh_ @solasthedouche @avachoolie @lynxkitsoni @adamchecknight @marvelstudios @theblackpanther then cancel the movie and postpone it until people are ready. i wasnt upset that black panther died, i was upset a astounding and compassionate black lead role actor had passed. somewhere along the lines people intersected those things #bringbackbettyross

bring back liv tyler as @thunderboltross now willam hurt has passed away

truth: betty ross is one of the biggest characters in the #mcu - why she is not there, ask @kevfeige please someone

#sdcc #sandiegocomiccon2022 @marvel @marvelstudios @henryboy111 @emansreviews exactly. kids saw a hero in t'challa and to take him away from them because chadwick passed away is just wrong. honor chadwick by continuing the story of t'challa. black panther made the most for a solo superhero movie in marvel and it won't happen again without t'challa @disney @marvelstudios happy you chose to pay tribute in wakanda forever to @chadwickboseman, &amp; also chose to explore the other characters in black panther/wakanda forever. however i feel a little less thrilled about the mantle not being passed on to shuri, like in the comics. @ekie0 @marvel i was never honestly ever going to watch the movie when he passed away cause i knew disney was never gonna try anything to save his character live | nous sommes prts  entrer dans le @marvel avengers campus lors de cette premire journe avant-premire pass annuel au sein du walt disney studios park !  https://t.co/c1gitzhzok @lengua_boi in the history of movies, there has always been recasting. superman (clark kent) played by christopher reeve and the joke played by heath ledger. both actors passed away and the fractional characters were recast.  marvel is preventing other black actors of this lead role. @sepia_cinema rt @emansreviews' #recasttchalla ""clarion call"" just gets louder @marvel @kevfeige needs to heed that call #chadwick's death was tragic but upon reflection, the role (like bond) should be passed down to preserve/compare legacy. just like connery vs moore for bond #afronerdradio @samuraisloth17 @miggytheacegod the reason that i had said that the mantle is getting passed down is because a set photo of t'challa's tribute had came with a text that wasn't in english and translated to ""restin power, king tchalla, our hero, twas an honor, wakanda forever"" @kvng__drizzy @eon1eno @emansreviews @marvelstudios sorry but that's what's happening. a set photo of t'challa's tribute had came with a text that wasn't in english and translated to ""restin power, king tchalla, our hero, twas an honor, wakanda forever""

it's definitely getting passed down @dawggirl27 @hbtd2021 @marvel @disneystudios @kevfeige i don't want the movie made, after he passed away. i just feel it well not be the same  @jerrellzod i mean.....t'challa is dead. the main core about this movie is honoring the legacy of t'challa and chadwick. a set video/photo for wakanda forever featured a supposed funeral

the mantle is getting passed down @marvel robert downey jr all the way, although ironman has passed away he made one of the greatest sacrifices. https://t.co/zhepw7eqdv even though chadwick boseman passed away i got a feeling #wakandaforever might flop if tchallas not around anymore @marvelstudios @marvel @guldaar @marvel @disney they gave him the amount to which he agreed under the contract. this was also his first contract which covered his maiden solo film plus a few crossovers. his next one was going to be big but sadly he passed away. @marvelstudios whats the point b actors as villains. marvel is officially on the level of dc comics now. reminds of season 4 of rwby after monty oum passed away. find a decent director or wait at least 10 years for a reboot. stan lee is turning in his grave ruining his legacy. what a shame. @marvel marvel entertainment

it's with deep sadness that we announce our dear friend and colleague mike pasciullo has passed away. @dylanfrayne @voodoosev @marvel no.

capt. america is a mantle. steve is his name.

thor is a name. you can't give your name away, especially in his culture, which i explained to you.

he had other titles he could have passed down, which i listed. iconic comic book artist tim sale has passed away at 66, he leaves behind a huge legacy of work #batman #spiderman #hulk #daredevil #superman @dccomics @marvel https://t.co/qtlcjpgnuv tim sale ( @artbysale ), best known for his artwork on classic collaborations with jeph loeb such as batman: the long halloween and the marvel ""colors"" series has passed away at the age of 66. rest in power https://t.co/k9camjo0j1 @lumumba8868 @marvelstudios @thorofficial @disneyplus what are you complaining about? have they said they intend to kill bast or have they said what happens to tchalla? or are you assuming the worst? i hope they give tchalla a hero's death and pass the torch of black panther to his sister shuri. how has he not been on equal grounds? @ekie0 @escaflowneclown holland would have to pass away to test that hypothesis. no opportunity was killed for black males, another reach. cant say squat either if they make shuri black panther either. @marvel iron man though he had pass away @laughatbrad @robertdowneyjr rdjs personal assistant on all marvel films passed away a year ago in a car accident at only 52. @starwars @marvel there are apparently no queer men in a galaxy far far away  pass @kvng__drizzy @baller_kamasi @jpemberton15 @ekie0 @amitdivecha1 @marvel na tchalla, as of the ending of endgame, is alive and well. the actor who played the character passed away. we dont need multiverse shenanigans to explain anything, the could simply just recast in the movie after wakanda forever. @alexand12477863 @eon1eno @thedenofnerds @drstrange @morbiusmovie ...morbius should get a bigger pass. sony is still awkward and the character was a risk. disney had all the time and money in the world to make a great film and they failed #multiverseofmadness wakanda forver will be the biggest mess of all this is heartbreaking. the legendary writer and artist george prez has passed away.

https://t.co/fykc59wcds @marvel oh man, this is hard. but that scene where his mother came into the room and start hitting steven. wow! that is the most saddest moment to me. also when steven realize that he knew it all along that his mother have passed away . ok to read. #thisweekinmarvel https://t.co/l16dswwsuu rt @marvel: marvel is saddened to learn artist neal adams has passed away. neal's photorealistic style helped shape the marvel universe and it is with a heavy heart i have to pass along the news that legendary comic book creator neal adams has passed away. we give our thoughts and prayers to his family and friends. 
#ripnealadams #ripneal @dccomics @marvel https://t.co/ikpsw63lwl @therealsupes hard pass. 
the film is called black panther. not the dora @marvel i like natalie portman. but if this film turns out to be some wokester bs crap then i will pass on this. remembering my friend herb trimpe, who passed away seven years ago today. you are sorely missed, pal. #herbtrimpe @marvel @hulk https://t.co/kcjxy5qlxu @bigpappipataky @marvel the real problem is the refusal of the comic book trademark farms to let real time pass in the books. the films allow time to pass and age and death to occur. @marvel @marvelstudios plz recast black panther to match the comic book. the character shouldn't be killed off because of the actor playing the role passed. not fair to us. 
blk men have been taken out households since paper food stamps &amp;  fam separation agenda, now its movies? @officialvystar @marvel @dccomics my hero is my grandma that passed away last year she died from covid but before she died she pushed me until she couldnt anymore and thats why im here today as strong as i am she raised me she was all i knew @officialvystar @marvel @dccomics my daughter linnette who was 25 when she pass away in 2020 on a motorcycles accident is my hero, my teacher and psychologist. thanks to her i realize that we are one with the universe (everything) and that we are not alone (separated), but just spatially extended from each other! @officialvystar @marvel @dccomics my #hero these days is my husband. my dad (who was my hero and very best friend) just passed away very suddenly a couple weeks ago. im shattered, heartbroken and over all just very saddened. my husband has been so supportive, helpful and has stepped up to take care of the kids! @turnbasedcarl @disneyplus it kind of makes more sense to retool her character this way to fit in the naming convention with capt marvel and photon. all of them sharing energy-based powers works. ill wait to pass judgment until i see it in action. @iamkingatn @rooneym4r4 @marvelstudios is that comment really necessary. it's not a marvel post. it's a post for an actor who has passed. he was also in other movies. go be negative somewhere else because this isn't it. @not_suler @elliottnewton9 @marvel clearly not being disrespectful say it was a family member for example and you wish things they could of done before they passed thats not being disrespectful but because hes saying it about an actor that means it is come on kid @berealwithdrea1 @rolandsmartin @botbsquad @kaizokusleven @chillmongerr hey marvel gets to make millions from killing off a fictional character js because the actor passed. we've never seen or had this suggested with any other ethnicity but hey, that's not sumthin we complain abt as people is it @impalergeneral @strangeadventrz @marvel @disneyplus passed away in the mcu or the 616? in mcu it appears mwi peggy will be coming in dsmom. @jenniferrcarey @strangeadventrz @marvel @disneyplus did you see #captainamericacivilwar? she passed away. she'll always be part of 616, but here's hoping a descendant will take over...named peggy @marvel @marvelheaux i do love dr. strange as a character. @marvelstudios  but no recasting of the first black superhero in the history of mainstream comics on film. i will pass seeing the movie.  king t'challa is black history and important to black culture.  @marvel recast finn jones as danny rand or pass on the legacy and then the story can be continued. bring in orson randall. @doingitforps4u1 @dandantransient @marvel @disney @jasonaaron i have a different post about scalped. scalped gets away with what it gets away with because its a noir, so a lot of those anti native tropes can get passed off as genre conventions. but scalped still is not exactly great in its portrayal of natives. @chiefwakil @yuhdunknoeh @dyani_2u which is why his torch should be passed not put out and locked away. 

i would also like black films to exist without all roads leading to slavery .... if shang chi can just be a good ass time with hands being thrown... so can black panther. https://t.co/ehnteq8fo7 @marvelstudios ok, get it, love it, when is black panther 2 release, we know the sister is playing bp, r.i.p chadwick bosemanamazing actor who pass the torch to letitia wright, with his blessings  #releasetheraimicut i like this idea &amp; hope it comes to pass @marvel @marvelstudios. however, i would love to see a new raimi film/limited series where #spiderman faces the fallout of everything that he's experienced over the last 20 years being turned upside down &amp; inside out. @emansreviews @ekhampton @gracerandolph i said legacy of the black panther, not t'challa. the black panther is a mantle passed to the protector of wakanda, not their king. t'challa was already black panther while his father remained king until he died. the new black panther won't necessarily be always their king. @fandomwire @marvelstudios @therealstanlee 1st, i thought stan filmed a bunch for use should he pass away. 2nd, i would like that. even if he is no longer doing speaking cameos. and used more like an easter egg. it doesnt dishonor him. his image should sign all marvel. @marvel i love this and we definitely need more but pls for the love of god continue x-men evolution as comic books, i need more content im going to explode without it and reviving the series when scott summers voice actor has passed seems disrespectful, thank you for your time what will @marvelstudios @marvel do now that the moon knight actor passed away , can you have someone else replace him? #moonknighttrailer #marvel #disneyplus #moonknight @ekie0 @marvelstudios @chadwickboseman chadwick boseman unfortunately passed away so have his character black panther pass away and have the sister become the queen @crushminister @disney @marvelstudios @kevfeige @emansreviews i dont know when an actor has passed irl and in cinema they wove it into the narrative. its sickening @gracerandolph #recasttchalla @marvelstudios @moonknight @disneyplus so sad that just when i thought we will get a wild series from marvel after daredevil, oscar isaac passed away. rip #gaspardulliel, star of #marvels upcoming #moonknight series, has passed away following a ski accident. he was 37.

the fact that are now trying to shit out nfts, and promoting it here is fucking disgusting and disgraceful to stans legacy

shame on you @marvel after seeing that they had the guts to use @therealstanlee's account, a legendary man that passed away, to promtoe nfts, i don't want to see or watch a single marvel movie or ip again, let alone modern ones.
you can go rot for using a dead mans corpse as a literal scam attempt. @biggaboss_biggz @disney @marvel they panicked after chadwick unfortunately passed away and made a decision literally right away to not recast tchalla without even thinking about it. they shouldve given it more thought. @emansreviews @chadwickboseman @marvelstudios @robertiger @vanlathan @jemelehill @drjasonjohnson if chadwick felt truly felt the role should be recast to another actor im sure he would have reached out to someone at marvel before he passed. if he truly felt strongly about it like your making out he may have even written something saying so. i dont want it recast @zero__followers @froste @marvelstudios what is this thought process?? chadwick was great but he only did 1 black panther mainline movie and now you guys just want to throw the whole character away now that he passed? thats so stupid and backwards  @biaking93 @marvel @dccomics george perez is one of those artists whose name was always a sign of quality for me, he sounds like the nicest guy too, and also in terms of the cause my cousin passed away from pancreatic cancer so i definitely support any charity related to that. now that @therealstanlee has passed (rip), i think #bettywhite should cameo in every @marvel movie from now on. @emansreviews and eon productions killed ""james bond"" in the last film (sorry, spoiler).  so, they're not going to continue with bond right? and just pass the ""mantle"" of 007 to someone else right? his kid sister right? nope. only marvel's 1st black hero can't ever be recast... https://t.co/qgat3bd0vi @ekie0 @vanlathan @ringerverse batman is always bruce wayne, though, in any incarnation or with any actor? im thinking more of superheroes who have passed on the identity. for example ms marvel, who was embodied by sharon ventura, karla sofen, kamala khan, &amp; carol danvers at different times. thats an option? think @marvelstudios should rethink this. superman/clark kent didn't stop being portrayed in live-action when christopher reeve passed or other notable fictional characters that have been tied to a particular actor/actress that played the character died. #tchalla #blackpanther @vanlathan @ringerverse a recasting that makes sense is bringing a t'challa variant into the main mcu tl or simply pass the black panther mantle down until t'challa's son is old enough to carry on the legacy. @vanlathan @ringerverse my view is that our t'challa has passed from this world, we will most likely have a new black panther in the next movie, and someday, there will be a t'challa from another part of the multiverse who can be played by an actor with their own interpretation of the character. it's been 3 years since @therealstanlee aka the man of marvel had passed away on 11-12-2018 #ripstanlee (we love you 3000) https://t.co/erhvxq0aok a quick sketch remembering my childhood hero stan lee who sadly passed away this day  3 year ago. legend. rip  @therealstanlee @marvel @marveluk @marvelstudios #excelsior https://t.co/rkluitbcll 3 years ago today the marvel legend @therealstanlee passed away. forever missed &amp; lives on in every marvel comic, cartoon, &amp; movie for generations to come.  we miss you stan. #excelsior #marvel #stanlee https://t.co/ycb8cpzdci remembering comic book legend @therealstanlee, who passed away on this day in 2018.

@marvel @dccomics @darkhorsecomics @imagecomics @kevfeige please recast t'challa the character is bigger than the actor. chadwick will forever be king but just as in the spirit of the world of black panther the mantle is passed. pay homage to the king and keep the monarchy established. it's been 1 year ago since @chadwickboseman aka t'challa  / black panther  &amp; star lord had passed away on 8-28-2020 #ripchadwickboseman https://t.co/fl3dbkj4qa wakanda mess is this @marvelstudios @marvel ? he's not an original ""avenger"" but @theblackpanther had a whole movie, there would be no shield without vibranium. @chadwickboseman passed away - the kingdom lives on! all he rates is shadow art? the audacity!! https://t.co/twzskh61mr i have so many fond memories of marvel vs. capcom 2. as a kid, i used to watch my dad play it on dreamcast, and playing it with him at an arcade on my 11th birthday was the last thing we did together before he passed away. @disney @marvel @capcomfighters #freemvc2 https://t.co/7mxbxtoct9 right now millions of @marvel nerds out there are seeing ""excelsior pass"" trending and coming away disappointed... https://t.co/mvvzw9hvsi abe has passed down his love for #spiderman and what better way to celebrate #spidermanday than with him handing down his first spidey suit to his little brother!

thank you @marvel @therealstanlee  https://t.co/pwvzuseuw6 hahah she lost 50 mil, and @disney be like yeah but you are insensitive to the covid pandemic so u are the bad person for not letting your 50 mil pass away #marvel @isthatscully @luke_goodlitt @marvel universal passed rights for one solo film, he's now legally only allowed to appear as a support character (ie ragnarok / avengers / she-hulk) @kastrokalikoe @iamjericho @marvel um the black panthers passed away unfortunately @jpalmiotti @marvel black widow was my first time back in the theater. the last time i went to a movie was to see parasite with my wife. which was also the last actual date with my wife before she passed away from brain cancer. even though stan lee has passed, rip, i think @marvel should still do his cameos. like a frame on a wall in each movie and a reference to his honor. but the reference has to be different in each movie. @bg3dai @marvel bro they been pissing me off when stan lee got old old and passed away @disney @marvelstudios chad would want another talented actor to have a chance at the panther role ..question knock on wood... if mark hamil passed after star wars there  would be no more luke skywalker? black panther is very important to the black community. rethink this. @gothjones @marvel @robertliefeld you want to know why i did not buy titles in 2017 i will tell you why, i was going every day to a hospital to help care for my dieing mother who passed away in 2018, now you want to talk shit come on. its with a heavy heart to learn a friend &amp; a mentor has passed away &amp; joined his marvel superheros in the afterlife. going to miss you my wolverine friend. @canadawolverine @marvelstudios @therealstanlee @pancancercanada #heartofgold https://t.co/uzpxmgdblz @marvel @marvelstudios @transformers @rajcomics @dccomics @jimlee

wakanda forever. @rinaldrin_lives @chadwickboseman marvel has been nothing but cringy since bro has passed away!! @chadwickboseman and whoever is running this accounts defense, i believe this is the last unreleased project from chadwick boseman that he did before he passed away. which is also his biggest as well. a lot of people make chadwick synonymous with the black panther @grubyperes @chadwickboseman recasting an actor who has passed is disrespectful. marvel recasted sometimes but because the initial actors quit those roles. chadwick loved playing tchalla. he's the panther. so if he dies, the black panther dies too. no other actor can live up to his work. @variety it will be very  interesting  to see what will happen  in the 2nd film now that @chadwickboseman passed away  almost 2 years ago . i remember  watching  the first black panther movie  and it was absolutely amazing.  it was a huge shock  that all along he was terminally ill . @umalumewabantu @timeslive who told you that foreigners they don't have rights. that's why they are called human right not south africans rights. you people serious you ran away from school. and this 40 percent pass really killed you. your mind is very shallow. #rt @variety: #doctorstrange is expected to expand its domestic gross to $388.6 million through sunday. that places it on track to pass the $389 million haul of guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 to become disneys ninth highest grossing marvel studios pro https://t.co/gxaqhrzavl just finished watching @blackpanther again. what a great movie. @chadwickboseman is truly missed. i painted this live with @scramjones in 2020 after chadwick passed away.  #blackpanther #chadwickboseman

https://t.co/z6hvdq5i3j @variety @amc_tv @amcplus great way to honor the legacy of t'challa @chadwickboseman by letting the mantle of black panther pass on to a new, unexpected &amp; deserving guy (this is getting super meta) @kevfeige &amp; coogler can make it happen!"
2,"@gracerandolph @stjude i hope they have enough extra footage to make a nice send off, i hate cgi for people who have passed away, feels wrong. agree that chadwick is t'challa, only person shuri calls brother, she could take over then a male actor in bp3 be a new different character+black panther suit. @escaflowneclown @jemelehill i agree 100% with the importance of the character for future generations. just like adam west passed away and batman lives on...so shall king t'challa/black panther. i believe black panther is even culturally a character of even more importance than batman right now. @mariasparios @royalvirtuemoir @themrmaj @ichironat @charlssh @gracerandolph to see that chadwick boseman, a great actor who plays black panther, tragically passed away are obviously gonna be upset because a great man died and a hero they looked up to (both tchalla and chadwick) died. @thegicker @jemelehill @simplyaj10 more irony: mr. boseman passed away on august 28th, the birthday of artist jack kirby who, along with writer stan lee, co-created the black panther. @gracerandolph idk if you heard but #chadwickboseman passed away! sad day!  https://t.co/t5hy4unvjc @jemelehill oh it has to keep going for sure. they can respectfully acknowledge his passing in the film. and it doesnt make sense to retire the role when the powers of the black panther come from the special flowers in wakanda! the powers can be passed on. @dprises @halleberry @jemelehill that doesn't do anything but show him black panther was an actor in the suit and not the true nature of the character he looks up to. the actor may have passed but black panther lives within my son thanks to @chadwickboseman and i won't kill that black excellence he helped create @jemelehill my mom loved all his movies especially black panther before she passed last year. we we use to watch this movie over and over  again dang. i love  watch him actor to. give my condolences to the family and friends. woow what amazing god given actor. rip. @khameekj03 this entire situation just sucks. tchalla is such a vital character to marvel and chadwick played him so perfectly and really made the character something special they couldve done so much more with him, but its just tragic and unfortunate that he passed away @justbrizard @wondermannews wtf are you on? i never delete my tweets and since 2020 after chadwick passed away i posted multiple times that i thought yahya abdul-mateen ii should replace boseman if marvel studios ever decided to bring in a t'challa variant from their multiverse. sorry u don't agree! @comics_scholar @resonantjustice @gracerandolph the scenario is an actor who was hired to play a fictional character that existed before them passed away thusly fictional character needs new actor to continue that character's story. @mz_sunflower @drboycewatkins1 a movie that kills off a fictional character played by an actor who passed away is not 'incredible' by any means. this weakens tchalla as a hero, within the context of the mcu; it eliminates a role for black male actors to portray someone positive &amp; powerful on screen - https://t.co/njbeq7cc7b @anthonyl1148 @rgleeson0304 @marvelstudios -- up to save t'challa from the fight. that is truly redeemable choice. besides you have to worship the bast first to become the black panther. i don't think alot of people would be that religious enough. chad was always will be our bp even if he passed away. @leiiaaorgana @thefirstokiro yes i believe its her, if you look at her mask, it actually matches her facial paint from the first black panther film which is a nice and beautiful touch! also the subtle touches of gold cause she liked the gold of the suit her brother passed up on  @skane2600 @__coleturner__ @lucasgnagy @mywakandanking wakanda forever was already in production when boseman passed away, so for all we know, whoever takes up the mantle here was always planned to do so in this movie @up2n0g00d8 the explanation is,
actor @chadwickboseman  tragically passed away from cancer. as he is no longer able to fulfill a role that he loved &amp; respected, we have decided to honor him by continuing the story of the hero he began a legacy and he inspired the world with.
#recasttchalla https://t.co/c9bum64b4l @iammauricew @ekie0 @guy_lnd besides; marvel was already planning to kill t'challa off, even before chadwick passed away; he was unhappy about the direction they wanted to go; cause he felt (and i agree) that black boys need to see themselves in more positive roles; 

https://t.co/ped1heh7re @jasonargonautai @jaelin_taylor @knickyfrmharlem did  you see this article that happened before chadwick passed away? marvel had plans to replace him all the way back then; so you're not wrong to say what you said - again - check the date jan 2020; chadwick would pass later that year aug 2020;

https://t.co/pcfu4dvr0h @purpleninjadrip @theblerdgurl @marvelstudios i could post multiple videos of chadwick boseman himself talking about how the role was important and bigger than he was. all these facts that aren't fan speculation and people are siding with a mega corporation looking to get a movie out on time after he passed away. @batmanbutasian @danieljsteele2 @marvel_updat3s fictional characters can't pass away. @jayfknkellz @ezyo1000 @dibingasimb its fiction. a movie where characters are recast if the original action is unable to perform. that actor for dumbledore passed and they still had 3 films he played a significant role. they recast. bp2 could be made w/o tchalla and recast him later down the line @yuhdunknoeh @mywakandanking @consumecomics i think we gave it a pass, cause we assumed we would get more tchalla, soon, and they'd make up for it with the next film; none of us knowing what the next few months would hold @arkingkyle the unimaginable being, forced to work on a movie sequel after the lead character and their close friend passed away so soon in order to keep the schedule of disney and marvel studios? clearly the sequel is too soon judging from the discourse @scarlettskyys @aceparadox @senpaishinobi1 @pano27527647 @mcuculture @croc_block none of us knew he would pass away; but just as audiences know joker, whether is jack nicolson, heath ledger, rip, jared leto, or the guy on gotham, or joaquin phoenix; audiences know who the character is in the movie; we'd know it's still tchalla; smh, we wish folks would stop @gracerandolph he was a great black panther.  i can't believe he passed away 2 years ago.  i cried at the end of black panther. @kylorenv2 @theafrotoad @bc42766710b @variety being purposely obtuse is weird. you know good and well tchalla is not the same as chadwick boseman. you know good and well just cause the 'actor' passed, does not mean they retire and kill off the character he played; #joker didn't do that for heath - why would mcu do that? @smugkaisupreme @cinemagamer1 @bc42766710b @thefirstokiro his family didnt say that he said that, his bro just said thats what he wouldve wanted, but chadwick did not know he was going to die and was prepping for black panther 2. his wife said that days before he passed he was confident that he would recover in time to film the movie @nahguylol @killer35durant @time17prime no its not, black panther is a mantle, it can be passed on and worn by anyone not just tchalla. didnt we see tchaka &amp; killmonger as black panther in the first film? yes we did. the mantle passed twice in one film. theres more than one spider man &amp; bat man too. @rappermantweets @kandigirl_3 @brettybungetty the actor who originally played hamlet has also passed away. @smithlocke11 @stylo_501 @kaijumik3 no, its feige keeping his word as best he can. he said he wouldnt james bond these characters. he doesnt want to replace actor after actor. its best to pass the mantle on or move on. thats more organic &amp; has more weight than tchalla,tony  &amp; steve go on forever. @kaijumik3 finally someone said it, thank you! 
knowing marvel they arent gonna recast :/ 
makes no dang sense, anyone who sadly passed away must be recasted especially if they are still relevant in the mcu and still have stories to tell. a @skinqueer @plantpapi__ it's not us that forced this movie to come out one and a half years after the lead actor passed away. there isn't any necessity for this movie whatsoever without the title character other than cash. i feel for the crew. but they were brave enough to show up for the paycheck @gamera_man waiting mere weeks and in the cases of some people days after the man passed away in order to try to shape the narrative of t'challa's franchise going forward would have been disrespectful. grief takes time to process. greed and selfishness doesn't hence their early decision @woodstock_tv @andi24mo nobody also releases a movie missing the titular character after the main actor passed away just a year-and-a-half ago but here we are. you still didn't answer my question. why is it disrespectful? @moistaphaaaa @debapack @b86482608 @heavymetalslug @starwars @disney @marvelstudios why isn't this irrational fear stopping white actors from getting jobs in hollywood that have been played by previous actors who did a great job or have passed away?
do you know that other actors have already asked to play the role? so if they aren't worried about it why are you @prettycoolduck @isuperebba huh?a couple of months means 2 months, chadwick passed almost 2 years ago. how is that a couple of months? the 1st film wasnt that good? yeah surethat film was solid &amp; it was a showcase for the black panther character thanks to chadwick. yet bp is a character that carries on. @franklioceanic @tristansmancave @cinephile1997 show us any petitions to back your statements up. the only vocal minority was the one that marvel studios listened to after chadwick boseman passed away who had hidden agendas on wanting to take over the franchise from him. @mntman1031 @gracerandolph i mean technically winter soldier comes in as one of the top mcu movies. and it is only a few million away from thor raganork so it will pass that as well. looking like it could possibly make the top ten domestic grossing marvel movies. we shall see. @ezyo1000 @escaflowneclown i do. there isnt no tchalla by choice, the man passed away in real life. this is the thing i keep trying to reiterate. its about sentiment, marvel doesnt have to do anything. we feel that loss. i want to see this movie to see the bp ethos expanded. theres so much story @spongelevacic @escaflowneclown @marvelstudios we weren't vocal about it out of respect for boseman who hadn't even been laid to rest yet i believe. the only people that were vocal (days after his death) were those who wanted their particular side character to take over the franchise &amp; saying no recast. proper time passed @manveeeel @anthonyl1148 @mluko3 @mcu_direct what film did you watch? tchalla was black panther before his father passed but was not both black panther and king of wakanda. @damunroe @yuhdunknoeh @mossmann42 @mmoyer92 @bc42766710b @marvel_n3ws bring up race is irrelevant bro, now you sound ignorant. also heath ledger passed away in 08 and the next joker appearence wasnt until 2016. its too fresh to recast chadwick who everybody loved @damunroe @scarletspider97 ""the original captain marvel""??? the original was a kree captain mar-vell. he passed away from cancer. monica rambeau used the name after wards.
don't tell me, you've never picked up a comic book?? @escaflowneclown @dood_anon this is different because he was apart of a cinematic universe where everything is connected. we cant go from chadwick as tchalla in 4 movies to a brand new actor in a sequel to black panther. it makes way more sense to pass the mantle down instead of recasting an already 1/2 @dood_anon think about all the drama behind part 2 right now. there's always something stopping production. that movies not ment to be. call it off recast tchalla new script or the orginal they had plan before he passed. @dood_anon @atumbem @gracerandolph @steventphoto92 first off i didnt suggest anything. its whats happening. second off, when did it become a negative stereotype for a king/warrior to pass away &amp; have a son setup to take over the kingdom? you guys are looking at it through an american lense, like tchalla was a dead beat dad @stnmountainyomi @kandigirl_3 @drackmint @gracerandolph chadwick is no longer with us, we dont need to slide some random actor into the role of tchalla when when its already built into the lore that the black panther mantle is passed on from successor to successor. tchalla is dead in the mcu, the black panther mantle is not.2/2 @dood_anon @stnmountainyomi @drackmint @gracerandolph maybe because chris hemsworth,chris evans &amp; robert downey jr didnt pass away between films. marvel studios is doing the right thing, honoring the man who brought the character to life. recasting would be a slap in the face to chadwicks family as well. shuri s the new bp. @gunnermanafc @itsyayaelaine @johnslpaul @marvelstudios @chadwickboseman they didn't plan for his death. and he had recorded his episodes long before. marvel plans some things in advance but they also react and change things on the spot too. just like how they changed the script for bp2 after he passed. @emansreviews @mattncheese @starrdiver he appears to be going off of articles from clickbait websites like screen rant. the same website that was posting misinformation about shuri taking over after t'challa quote died in the comics just days after chadwick boseman had passed away @bc42766710b folks that have no knowledge of marvel comics shouldnt be making black panther political, black panther as a character isnt going anywhere, but the mantle should be passed on. tchalla is one of many to become black panther, out of respect for chadwick, we can leave the legacy @mastertainment mt you notice only the black characters that inspire majority of black ppl is being killed because of an actors passing. they ain't do it to supes, joker , etc. an entire legacy and inspiration killed and using a man that passed as an excuse to do it. smh. let black panther live @mastertainment 2) and activist who passed away after portraying the marvel character ""t'challa"" in their first ""black panther"" movie. https://t.co/qzjkgqmtuv @ericamusic_96 @thereal_vincii his brother was the one that was asking as well as chadwick boseman himself as confirmed by roland martin but continue on with their silly diatribe. hamlet is an iconic character. what do you think they should have done with that character after the actor passed away? @kipvelcrono @robertd1905 @genecist84 @mastertainment im not trying to. i just know 2 people personally who told me that they waited their entire life to see tchalla on the big screen as a hero who truly represented them.
now marvel is telling me that because boseman passed away that their representation doesnt matter? it sucks. @tchallalives66 whos erasing him? the black panther is gonna be shuri, tchalla is gonna pass away in the movie somehow more than likely. you dont disrespect a mans life just so your movie doesnt change. @pandachill_ @crzr125 it's called healing as well. going to the director and asking him what he's going to do about the movie just days after attic bozeman passed away probably wasn't the best timing for that question. death takes a little time to get over emotionally before you return to logic. @db44143189 @thecinemaguy17 @twitterdata because chadwick boseman passed away and black panther got a story in the avengers game. where have you been? why else would it be at number 4. they arent solely talking about the movie. youre really trying hard to twist the narrative.  @cubanalife @gracerandolph yeah what a scoop. cause thats what marvel does. wsits for the hype of one film to pass then release the next trailer. herdly groundbreaking journalism @awaytoseas @rpk_news1 he didn't pass. his actor did. you might learn the difference between reality and fiction before interjecting @escaflowneclown bruh preach! i was saying to my wife this morning if this was a white character would they be erasing this fictional character if the actor tragically passed  marvel studios yall fing up @vinndiggs92 @biglildoug @jemelehill imagine if he came from a universe where tchaka played by denzel died while he was a boy and he became the extremely smart and extremely paranoid version closer to the comics.  boseman would be happy to pass that level of stardom to another black actor full circle @escaflowneclown maybe don't equate the recasting a role out of respect for an actor who passed only about a year ago with recasting an actress who's being a fucking moron?? these two things are not the same. also plenty of other characters have been black panther @fjlightning007 @quintinlamarr @db44143189 @renzothesaint @bpanthernews as did dumbledore. as did spartacus. if we decided to kill a character every time an actor passed then there would be no iconic characters. this completely ignores the art of storytelling all because kevin feige and marvel studios chose to pander in the moment to keep a schedule @quintinlamarr @fjlightning007 @db44143189 @renzothesaint @bpanthernews there's outrage now. the very 1rst black marvel hero had his franchise completely co-opted and turned into some type of fanfiction. the character didn't pass away the actor did. marvel always recasts their white characters. if it were spider-man what do you think would happen @danielc26531669 @jlhill56 that's too convoluted. the most chadwick thing they could do is guve that immensely important character to another up and coming black actor to help their career. and pass it along generationally like james bond @escaflowneclown @royaldeafpanda @gamora444 misinformation about shuri taking over the franchise when panther dies started spreading just days after chadwick passed on all of these junk sites and social media. that close proximity helped the lie spread just as fast &amp; wide as news of chadwick's death now ppl regurgitate it @robertd1905 @ekie0 @sanemjfan @emansreviews @escaflowneclown @tchallalives66 @johnslpaul @brodie9992 marvel didn't know he was going to die; most likely they had entire plans for tchalla in future movies and 'stories' - they essentially changed those stories because cb sadly passed away; and that just makes no sense. it doubles up on the trauma of losing cb already smh #careless @robertd1905 @yuhdunknoeh @boss_htown @escaflowneclown exactly, i had tweets from long before boseman's passing complaining about t'challa in the first film but being hopeful and excited about the sequel. 

i also remember ppl pushing shuri as black panther in the sequel long before boseman passed. @yuhdunknoeh @redkingeddy @tfoxrng @troyoboyo17 im not saying that, im saying its a superhero, they have roles that get passed down in the comics. its not something new, recasting him is just dumb to do after the actor died. im not saying never having a new black panther just not in the mcu cause its disrespectful. @redkingeddy @tfoxrng @troyoboyo17 its like if grant gustin died rn and the next season of the flash they get a different actor for him, instead of you know, just having a goodbye for him. its just disrespectful, and black panther isnt like a tchalla only thing, its a role thats passed down so they should. @11masonman11 @khameekj03 its not that shes hated. the character of tchalla is just too iconic in marvel and has barely made any appearances in the mcu. its appropriate to pass the role onto another actor. writing off a character or having them mia, would put chadwicks work to waste. @yuhdunknoeh that is not what was said or implied. the black panther is literally intended to be passed down, even if t'challa is one of if not the greatest to ever do it. his story has evolved numerous times over and has been enhanced for it. that legacy going to someone else can be a part - @escaflowneclown @screenrant from the same website that started petitioning and making articles/ spreading misinformation for #shuri. 2 become #blackpanther exactly three days after #chadwick passed away @evibbles666 @tchallalives66 do you think for a second they wouldn't recast peter paker if tom holland passed away? or if robert pattinson died they wouldn't recast bruce wayne? but chadwick tragically passes away so that's it for black panther??? https://t.co/r3g5aoxf7q @escaflowneclown @tchallalives66 @brie_stephany @badwolf48f if chadwick hadnt passed, it may have been. you cant compare the two. im questioning why in her second film, not her third, her second, captain marvel is sharing the marquee given its huge success. the character didnt give. many women and men didnt resonate with her. jmi @tchallalives66 @reverselamaj convenient how. he literally says the mantle has been passed down for generations, we can have a new hero take up the title of black panther without recasting t'challa which is what i think they will do. leave t'challa as chad's legacy but let someone else be bp @bill64burner @yuhdunknoeh @khameekj03 its not disrespectful at all. he passed away. chadwick would want the show to go on. i believe he still would want young black men to have a powerful character taht they can feel empowered by. by killing of the character, people are going to forget who black panther is @gracerandolph imma pass on ur opinion on this one, theres this marvel fan on tiktok who is really educated on like everything and i trust her and she thought the film was amazing. https://t.co/iudjlzatxm @ninjanightwing @thegiftedgemini @khameekj03 exactly, it's dumb, i mean ye it's sad that the actor passed, but he isn't the first black panther actor, and i doubt he'll be the last. @straderzane @gracerandolph kevin fiege basically hated everything that jeph loeb did so no he is not going to incorporate the netflix suit. the actors get a free pass because they are beloved and also both marvel film and tv use the same casting directors. @gracerandolph i hope that black panther: wakanda forever will be a great tribute &amp; honors the legacy of 
chadwick bosemans black panther &amp; that they pass on the mantle to either shuri or mbaku by the end of the movie &amp; sets up the wakanda series! i cant wait for the arrival of doom &amp; namor! https://t.co/lzyaajdcdi @tchallalives66 @emansreviews thats y im saying pass the black panther torch down to the sister like in the comics which is what the movies are based on. in my opinion recasting t'challa is saying that he is replaceable and all we need is a black actor. yet we need more than just a replacement we need a icon"
3,"disney's only focus right now is paying tribute to chadwick boseman and not on making 'black panther 2'

no one involved with #blackpanther was aware chadwick was sick. kevin feige found out after he had passed away

#movie #trailer #tv #hollywood #gaming @hollywoodrecs @netflix @thr @latimesmovies https://t.co/plk22wk5wh @ew i totally 100% disagree. as a fan of the comic books there was a black panther before him and there will be one after him. why destroy the one good black character in the comic series because an actor passed away. i look forward to the next movie in this series with a new actor. @netflix netflix, why did you take ""black panther"" out of rotation after he passed away?  i know it was there last week so please don't say that it was time, because it had been there for years?
if it's not placed back, i will start a petition and cancel my subscription. @netflix netflix, why did you take ""black panther"" out of rotation after he passed away?  i know it was there last week so please don't say that it was time, because it had been there for years?

if it's not placed back, i will start a petition and cancel my subscription. @netflix wha wha wha wait so chadwick boseman passed away and netflix thought it was a good idea to pull the movie black panther out of selection  shame on you and all.of a sudden xfinity is charging to watch it you guys are the scum of the earth! @thr how did #chadwickboseman hoodwink disney ? how was he supposed to know that he was going to pass away from cancer at 43 years old? its just a film , he was brilliant in the film #blackpanther @callme_scooby @transformaro @darkcommander_ chadwick boseman, black panther has passed away. just in - #blackpanther star #chadwickboseman (43) passed away. he had been battling colon cancer for the last three years. #ripchadwickboseman   @thr  #hollywood  @deadline https://t.co/tqvfgxy1vt @thr @chrisevans, @robertdowneyjr, @markruffalo, @chrishemsworth, @samuelljackson, @tomholland1996, 

@chadwickboseman got passed away today. he did the black panther. @golden_dragonv @thr you sound like a deeply unpleasant person and im so glad to not know you irl. you couldve stopped after its sad to see him pass but that last sentence really shows that the only reason you didnt see black panther was because you were upset that black people hyped the movie @markruffalo its very sad he passed away so much to offer . mark i bought a black panther shirt an when i stepped out to catch the city bus a guy stopped me an said wakanda forever https://t.co/yym7bto5mz @thr art imitates reality, reality imitates art. the mantle of black panther is passed on in comics and must be passed on here. importance of the franchise to ppl of color, appeal of characters to ppl of color and to all ppl are too great to let the franchise go away. @markruffalo @chadwickboseman i cant believe that chadwick boseman passed away rip. wakanda forever. #blackpanter @thisfuckin_guy @culturecrave she does but tchalla was needed to be in black panther 2 to progress the story and pass the mantle naturally it might confuse kids more if all of a sudden black panther is female. also would not be the first actor to switch roles in the superhero universe would it ? @ew fuck that noise.i'm a black panther fan &amp; i want the character to live onscreen beyond chadwick's immense portrayal.we have so few iconic black superheroes as it is, that retiring our biggest one because actor has passed is self-defeating.never do this for 007, batman or superman @the_sadcat @cosmicwonderyt she hulk is a different story that show was a joke itself but i still enjoyed it for what its for. this movie clearly had a different tone and its a more serious film considering it will deal with the pass of chadwick and the black panther. yall just tryna hate on anything @kyle_castorena @ghostpepper1246 @culturecrave if im correct, marvels rising gave her a new backstory with her being an iron man fangirl and she invents like tony stark as an escapism when her father passed away. @xactic_valor @thr yeah, because chadwick was the black panther in real life  and he died in the line of duty. 

oh wait, no. he's an actor that played a fictional character and there are several black panthers because the mantle is passed along when the previous black panther @beepinggoat22 @cosmicwonderyt @thr until infinity war. and marvel changed alot after stan lee passed away... except spiderman, moon knight, shang chi and loki. this is just my personal opinion brother... @twosevenfs @damleo86 @iot_apprentice @ymdnny @culturecrave @thedirect that's not my point. it's not that it's not t'challa, it's that this is going on all at once after chadwick boseman's death. which does make me believe that either marvel or disney want to get rid of t'challa now that the actor that played him his passed away. harrison ford teportedly is or was marvels top choice to star as general ross in thunderbolts.

he is not currently cast in the film but its unclear if hes already passed on the role.

(source: @theinsneider) https://t.co/ardoz36hg9 @damleo86 christopher nolan had a clear story set out and so did marvel but marvels was threw off after chadwick passed away and they felt it was wrong to recast him. @damleo86 @spookyluke_ @squidstocks1 @marchey304 @danualthemanual @webheaded_josh @culturecrave @theinsneider the movie was already in development as his movie before he passed away, the fact you have a black panther profile picture and are disrespectful chadwick like this. @squidstocks1 @damleo86 @marchey304 @risenhellboy @danualthemanual @webheaded_josh @culturecrave @theinsneider he died between that and the new black panther movie because his on screen actor, chadwick boseman passed away. they didn't want to recast because it was just too soon. @damleo86 the logical reason is because chadwick passed away and marvel don't wanna recast @yungstorydawood @comicbook @thealexrossart @marvel my guess is because chadwick passed away and its marvel excuse to downplay the most popular black character they have. i know thats extreme but the way they have been handling tchalla is genuinely awful and its feels very deliberate. @damleo86 @khanl0l @rodolfocortez04 @discussingfilm i knew the character way passed the 2 hour film and cameos of the other handful of movies he was also in (civil war, infinity war, end game) but passing the mantle is more respectful than just going ahead and recasting. more than t'challa has been black panther.  @minato2002007 @charlieoliver @marvel agree, creators do deserves their payment, but right now we need to pay a fellow writer respect that just passed away. nothing like a theatre almost to ur self @omniplexcinema antrim @marvel #thorloverandthunder @chrishemsworth looking forward to this my dad passed away a few months ago been first since top gun. https://t.co/oiioyzkawx @mr_arizona2424 @thr so zombify person that just passed away is perfectly normal to you?

alright, let's get chadwick boseman out of his coffin and put him in black panther 2. @johnnyalucard @thr kirby had cameos in the older marvel tv shows wayy before the mcu was even thought of, he passed away in 94 @frexerpw @culturecrave @thr meaning even though stan has passed away, marvel will still use his likeness to attract attention and further profit of his image. implying, zero respect for the dead. @ethankleinman @goattanjiro @keathmayes @culturecrave new mutants was a film that was created before the fox and disney merge so of course it got pushed back, morbius is a sony marvels production, and black panther two got pushed because  the main actor passed away @geekvibesnation nice to see marvel going pass the normal pg-13 rating. @sanemjfan @noxxers1 @comicbook no that wouldn't have been okay. they are the faces of the mcu and shouldn't be touched once they pass away. if they can have shuri briefly take it and have that plot make sense, before resting the black panther for a future generation (i.e. her children) that would be fine. 1/2 @markruffalo 2 of my sons in front of you at the marvel exhibit at henry ford musuem. the older one idolized stan and was devastated when he passed away. https://t.co/s4pogiehbw @noxxers1 @comicbook whats weird about it ? black panther aka  tchalla was a character long before chadwick was born his passing was sad but the character shouldnt be written off or left alone because the actor playing him passed away @swiftieun1corn nice i last went in the summer saw cruella. everything else if they offer on demand watch at home but most are going back to theaters only. like i watch the new one about venus and serena the other day. i'm not big into marvel so i can pass lol @culturecrave @vanlathan just let some time pass, and if there is an actor that's right for the role, then do it, continuing the story of black panther. whether it's 616 or other universe, that's besides the matter, because we love black panther, we loved chadwick, and we want to see the story continue. @culturecrave @thr it's just another marvel movie, nobody gives a shit. and besides real black panther has passed away @polarbrosteven @boopbopbeep51 @nkanyezi_iv @amurkymuc @iamfabiomartins @culturecrave @thr ...which is 100% irrelevent to the fact that the very selling point of the film has passed away.

who cares if other people can/have become the black panther?

chadwick is black panther. 

regardless of the comics, it's like replacing arnold as the terminator. https://t.co/b6ehhp9gwz @swiftieun1corn @culturecrave we canceled on monday b/c covid booster knocked us down, but we have been to every marvel premiere &amp; fan event this year. by accepting your pass, you are agreeing to not talk details. i lost friends over black widow because i followed the rules. @culturecrave @ew the only death that really hurt was tchallas  in episode 6 cause chad is actually dead. ik they made it before he passed but seeing that combined with how weak his voice sounded was a lot for me @ironninja013 @newprreunion30 @marvel_mmo @geekvibesnation @nostalgianation @comicbooknow @geeksofcolor @geektomeradio @teamjdf @tatothedoublej yes but she passed away in a car accident. that is the second yellow ranger marvel will no longer do any stan lee cameos

4,"@bowtiezrcool88 @rwby_fan10000 @thr ok but i feel this is different as those actors didnt pass away during their time while playing those characters. respectfully the black panther title should fall to shuri or okoye!! @mcu_direct @marvelstudios honestly i'm still in shock that #chadwickboseman passed away from colon cancer. i'm still not ready to even think about #blackpanther 2. #wakandaforever https://t.co/k3lai3psry @rwby_fan10000 @mcu_direct @marvelstudios they have to recast black panther.  the original actor passed. they cant  just eliminate character. @johnottaway @vin_for_the_win @mcu_direct as usual.. u guys will never understand this tweet.. is shuri t'challa?.. what happened to tchalla after infinity war 2?.. how did he pass away?.. nobody knows .

all we see is shuri being black panther.. and it feels incomplete bcoz t'challa is as iconic as parker/stark/banner @nachoavgrandy @marvel @spiderman but who would play #bonesaw though since the original passed away? #ripmachoman @wallynox6 @thiskidjayden @mcu_direct how do you know the plot leak is correct? since wakanda forever was announced and chad passed, it was clear shuri was bp and namor was in the film. what else do the plot leaks say thats confirmed with the trailers?? @harsha_027 @holder_leo @tyronbigum69420 @mcu_direct yeah, i get what you mean. i'm of the opinion that the first black panther was fuckin horrible, and only gets a pass because of it's black representation. i can appreciate the black representation, it was still a fucking horrendous film. @shehulk when it comes to a marvel film or show, honestly the thing that matters most is the youtube critics, because they'll be honest and have actually good reasons for thinking something is bad, but critics just see that it's a marvel movie and give it a pass. she-hulk is not very... @thehappyginger1 @mcu_direct while i understand people who want to recast, it's not the same thing. marvel recasted actors who were still alive and appeared in one movie like fandral, hulk, and rhodey. chadwick was in four movies and in what if, then passed away @grandy_sammy @ceruleanshadowx @mcu_direct @chairmangao you also forgot hawkeye was kate bishop 
if they can cuc hulk and thor ofcouse daredevil will be next on the character chopping block black panther passed away but still a part 2 must be made cause there is money to made @howlingwolfjoey @wildcardmoviez @blondedhelmet @mcu_direct because it was the first marvel movie to get a 45-day waiting period until d+. black widow required either a $30 pass or 90 day waiting period. this took away the incentive for people to see shang chi at theaters. @mcu_direct i thought they were gonna keep tchalla alive, saying that hes off being black panther elsewhere, wouldnt that be a better tribute? saying that while the actor passed the character he helped mold will live on?! @mcu_direct it's not gonna be a black panther movie because 1.) cb has passed away, 2.) they haven't recast his role, and 3.) if they somehow bring back the heart-shaped herb after km burned it all, it'll be too convenient and hard to explain @mcu_direct i love chadwick, and love the character of tchalla, but i mean we all know he wouldnt have gotten nominated if he didnt pass away and that wasnt his last project @_dylan_1999 @killava49 @busted_babe @mcu_direct and wins in the fight then yeah a white character can become black panther. and the requirement of captain america is being an american hero which sam wilson is. he also fought alongside steve, also steve literally passed down his legacy to him, so sam wilson is captain america. @theanimehits @jaymasteryoda @mcu_direct you dont have to recast him, however just start over. tchalla has passed away and its shuris time to step up and be the queen of wakanda. similar to how tchallas ark was in civil war and his own movie black panther. 

but we both know marvel wont do that. @therealchrisemu @mcu_direct why do you think that? you haven't even seen black panther wakanda forever or even see a trailer for it. fyi black panther wakanda forever will paid a tribute and honor chandwick boseman who passed away on august 28,2020 due to colon cancer
r.i.p chadwick boseman wakanda forever https://t.co/nqvflz1d7y @officialzay56 @everythinggeek_ @cityof_me @mcu_direct they have to move on at some point, they shouldnt stop giving us a beloved character just because the actor passed away

they should just bring back killmonger or smth and redeem him, or if tchalla had other cousins to take the mantle @xswezzy8 @cityof_me @mcu_direct you do know chadwick bozeman the person who played black panther passed away right ? and they didnt want to recast him because no one could play tchalla how he played him so shuri taking up the mantle makes since because she is tchalla sister smh  @mcu_direct no chadwick boseman(or at least a recasting of panther with a comparable actor) and ""mayan namor""
hard pass. 
haven't paid for a marvel movie since end game and it isn't lookin like you're getting any of my family's money any time soon. even my kids are bored with your mediocrity @meiechigan @wookiecookies2 @davidb10001 @dallasmacdouga2 @the_bytemaster @wallynox6 @mcu_direct it was. until feige told perlmutter to screw off in 2015 and marvel studios was removed from the rest of marvel entertainment. that was the same time marvel tv stopped getting scripts from studios. that's why you stopped seeing film characters show up pass season 2 @mcugeekthe @mcu_direct i'm obviously referring to the marvel shows they already released and later censored referring to it as a ""glitch"", and then also removed the tributes to the people who have passed away within the netflix marvel shows that have moved to #disneyplus https://t.co/s5wxu0vopm @mcu_direct i will not watch it i feel like it will be disaster all actors say it be good but without  the main man tchalla or chadwick himself i dont think this movie can live up it's full potential sorry gonna have to pass wish the best on this film @cjwritesthings it wasn't the last marvel project reg e. cathey was involved in before he passed away. @omsnoms420 @helsingdemon1 @captain63857795 @mcu_direct ghost rider is a pretty big marvel character, and as i said i'm talking like 15-20 years here, if they choose to keep the mantle being passed for that long. whenever the danny actor gets tired, there's alejandro, and when alejandro's actor gets tired, so on and so on @jimeemij @kagen27_ @marvel_dc_616 @mcu_direct also what is your obsession of this actor getting cast as hulkling i've seen better fancast who look like they could pass for teenagers. @lepp_david @marvel @spidermanmovie three spiderman fight and cure their enemies, peters aunt pass away @4getmeenott @mcufan3000 @mcu_direct exactly. that's like saying joker shouldn't be played anymore after heath ledger passed away. it's a role. tchalla has many more stories to tell. @arthurmorganboa @mcufan3000 @mcu_direct you mean like the real people who created tachalla and wrote his most iconic stories. when some of them passed away no one said black panther cant ever be written by anyone else again. your logic is so faulty its laughable @manintrenchc0at @crimsondude7 @mcu_direct also this point. but before he passed away i saw rumors about shuri about being the next black panther anyway ? so maybe she will @manintrenchc0at @crimsondude7 @mcu_direct idk about tchalla honestly. its gonna be weird to be someone else than chadwick playing him he put so much efforts into playing this character idkbut im curious to see how theyre gonna bring up the fact that hes passed away @mcu_direct no cause i was literally thinking about how hawkeye would be the new cap, black panther (before chadwick passed, rip) would be iron man, and thor would obv be thor by doing his own thing. @a_chris_g_film @mcu_direct @spidermanmovie @spiderman @_spiderman @spiderman3news @spiderman_news @ujstrikesback @marvelfans4ever @marvel_tv @marvelclimate you can't pass on tobey @_ajmyers_ @everythinggeek_ or, anyone saying no could in fact be a massive marvel fan who doesn't want to see chadwick boseman's best role taken by another actor. many roles are retired when an actor dies. brian o'conner, livia soprano, dr. loomis... 
if they pull some multiverse magic, okay. if not, pass. @mcu_direct pretty much, marvel says they own the rights to these characters because they were created by marvel as a collaboration and not one specific person.  the estate of individuals (some who have passed away) disagree and want the rights instead. @aidenlampitt @alkimewastaken @lunwi88 i feel it isnt fair to not have fun with a character just because their actor passed, black panther is tchalla not chadwick. chadwick plays the character doesnt mean he is the character so i really think its a cool idea to turn him and the rest into zombies @mcumarvels @mcu_direct @kevfeige chadwicks brother already confirmed that chadwick supported the role being passed from actor to actor. there are multiple interviews. just because you ignored them doesnt make them go away. you clearly hate #chadwickboseman and want to erase his legacy. shame on you for that. @spiderman3news probably just spidey nwh (out of marvel/dc) if it is as big as we hope its gonna be, then that. zsjl and godzilla vs kong were movies that i really looked fwd to and now we've passed that. however, i heard the russos are working on a gatchaman film! @mcu_direct fun fact: in the original marvel comics, after tchalla passed away, shuri became the new ruler of wakanda and the black panther  https://t.co/jp2l34jpfm"
5,"@machocamacho03 @discussingfilm why are they different? both actors, sadly, passed away, their characters did not, they should recast them both. especially t'challa being a very important character in the marvel universe and also being such an iconic black superhero. @uberfacts the sequel is likely being scrapped because chadwick boseman passed away doo 2 lung cancer rather than coronavirus. there might be a movie entitled after the reigning superhero's mate. there is only one king who lords it as the wakanda chief. wakanda forever! https://t.co/ybmxko6b6x @treystar679 @discussingfilm because t'challa is the protagonist and a beloved actor. ross was a side character. two years ago nobody wanted black panther recast. now that grief has passed people are acting like they weren't the ones that didn't want him recast. @ikjoneso4 @thatboywhitt1 @jibinbinnu_ @the4threjected @discussingfilm black panther is a moniker which has been passed down from different generations. (t'chakka, t'challa and shuri). it isn't really about recasting the character so much as it is about continuing a legacy @farhan__mehmood @discussingfilm no its obvious she is going to be black panther. no other way around it since the actor passed away. @discussingfilm wow this is a juggernaut of a film. i didnt anticipate it to pass black panther tho. i still believe it will win best picture at the #oscars2023 @mattizzle9 @discussingfilm i think tchalla was a very important charecter and just because of the actor as passed they shouldn't have to kill the charecter i mean years of world building and then something happens and its all in trash if someone did something like this with tony or steve then what @dahiyaknight @discussingfilm not every film has to pass 1 billion in the box office u marvel fan boy @isvicsalvadead @discussingfilm there might be scenes set before he passed away that kamaru will be doing as tchalla. @discussingfilm look. i saw the wakanda forever trailer. i cried. for five hours. and i hope their break downs and tears are for it too.

your suffering allows me to feel the warmth that was sorely needed after chadwick passed away. you should be grateful.

don't want to think you as ungrateful. @anansiworld @directorsmiso @discussingfilm @jeffgrubb i agree. i think they should have just recast him. its tragic he passed away but the character is overall too important within marvel and too important for real world representation to be abandoned. im not optimistic the next movie will be good due to all the rewrites. @aussious @discussingfilm but the black panther is. the previous black panther passed away do now a new one must come forward whether that's shuri or m'baku has yet to be seen @discussingfilm this was the best marvel trailer ever. go argue with yo mammy,  and for all you recast tchalla fools who wanted ryan coogler to put a different actor in this role and move on like his good friend didn't pass in real life are clowns @discussingfilm @deray i have a black panther poster in my bedroom. i got it for xmas. the actor who played the titular character passed away young due to lung cancer. nope. he wasn't high with cigarettes. https://t.co/zw9kkeeqqa @matthewacherry this was the best marvel trailer ever. go argue with yo mammy,  and for all you recast tchalla fools who wanted ryan coogler to put a different actor in this role and move on like his good friend didn't pass in real life are clowns @popbase this was the best marvel trailer ever. go argue with yo mammy,  and for all you recast tchalla fools who wanted ryan coogler to put a different actor in this role and move on like his good friend didn't pass in real life are clowns @discussingfilm @jstorm00 i'd find it hard to believe that chadwick would'nt want the black panther role reprised. it's odd that the character is basically being wrote off because he passed away. find another great actor, and there's plenty, and honor chadwick that way. t'challa needs to live on. @discussingfilm there's no pleasing anyone in this situation. if they had recasted t'challa people would bitch and complain. rip chadwick bosemam but i think marvel was right in doing this. just like in the comics  people die and mantels get passed down. @aussious @marvel_updat3s just say you hate women. chadwick literally passed away and yall still have the audacity to be sexist @anansiworld @haileternal how would a recast help when you have these trash writers and directors. i love the actor and i am really sad he passed away, but man, movies were total sh*t. first black panther movie was soo bad. @popbase @msmarvel ms marvel already outsold nicki pigaj @wolfdeerbra @classicniko1 @thekrabs_11 @rydondisdik @absentbabydaddy @haileternal he was competing to challenge his rule. if he won, he would have become king, not black panther.

also, black panther and king of wakanda are separate roles that tend to be held by one person. t'challa was already bp, his father had passed on the role before his death @haileternal i have zero faith in black panther 2 because chadwick boseman passed 

just cancel it @discussingfilm quite corporate of them to treat the likeness of the one who gave a lot to them - who passed away after been robbed in his last years &amp; been attack by some of the marvel employees for been an white guy - like an ip property.

very of disney &amp; their corporate acolytes. @discussingfilm it's already passed the first film so marvel is likely going to be happy with the results. @jjm__56 @afathersbastard @seanwel33239440 @seohoops @moses091115 @wednesdaypull @marvel i could see that happening if he came from a timeline where peggy hasn't passed away yet or if he's taking care of a family there its the first mothersday/parentsanniv since my mom passed away. so heres to the celebs whos on screen stories help me cope @simuliu (shangchi) and @kumailn (eternals)! #marvel #coping #mothersday #superheroes #aapiheritagemonth @minejack7 @isamvalensi @havingfundying @jmtaylor21 @haileternal they don't get a ""pass"" it's a different style of narrative they went for. they had a lot more characters then any other marvel film combined. iw/endgame was a grand finale to their inner franchise. dr strange isn't, it's a continuation. @boss_htown @discussingfilm just cause hes not recast now doesnt mean he cant be in the future, the man just passed last year, give that wound time to heal, im all for another black panther movie without us having to pretend its not the same actor, especially when the actor is literally dead #rip @discussingfilm after morbius my hope for sony marvel films is lower than my dad in the ground (he has passed away.) @roody273 @desertchocolat1 @wednesdaypull legacy mantle as in captain america, captain marvel, batman etc being passed down to another person. @here4choas @discussingfilm it's the worst dc/marvel film so far.
i'm hopeful we will see worse as time passed  https://t.co/pyicnndhzm @ghost0nee @venomknight14 @hzjoetv most marvel movies don't have their lead actor pass away and their most likely replacement lead causing multiple issues on set. @jakemillzzzz @armax_haha @unclebatseid @poisonousnathvn @culturecrave @simuliu it still underperformed considering its huge opening of $160 it shoulda done at least 450 , it's only just passed bw(which was released on day and date) and it won't pass sc, it won't turn a profit(yes i know a lot haven't because of the pandemic but this is a marvel film...) @felixtheiii @believeinfed @discussingfilm it definitely won't pass any mcu or marvel film at the domestic box office this yr but i doubt they care as it will probably overtake shang-chi ww and maybe venom 2 unless venom 2 is released in china
https://t.co/xn7owvboej @emptyvords @igorcio147 @tri_state26 @aidendomdozier @emylcastillo @godspeedyboi1 @discussingfilm your argument is a bit strange. for current writers this would go.
this case mainly focuses on ditko (left marvel already in 60s &amp; passed away in 2018) and stan lee who quit writing also long before disney came close. stan got 10million once from marvel before the mouse came. @hawttoys @simuliu an observation:  bruce lee passed away in 1973.  the character shang-chi first appeared in 1973.  seems marvel was paying tribute to lee. @oracledream1 @simuliu you tweeted man posts about an actor who passed away and continued to say ""marvel stans calling him angel"" like bruh so what if they called him angel, you have an account which stans a actress and a movie ffs @simuliu man post about an actor who passed away
marvel stans : ""you're an angel  *post fancam*"" @discussingfilm it was very shocking when he passed last year, i wasnt really a fan of black panther yet at the time so i decided to watch it with my mother for the first time soon after he passed. after seeing the film, i completely understand why this man was so epic. rest in peace  @buzzsantos @discussingfilm 1. marvel and dc characters are usually created by two people, a writer and a artist, although most endgame characters were created by just a few (stan lee, jack kirby, steve ditko, joe simon...). this four has already passed away. @magnegro666 @discussingfilm yes, multiple characters can share the same name its a legacy that can be passed down. like black panther just because his ancestors were black panther does that mean hes not black panther"
6,"@jberr59 @graysonoir @damleo86 @discussingfilm a daughter being introduced didn't mean he be done right away. by the third movie possibly but still it wouldn't go against anything the mcu has showed us. new hawkeye, new black widow, new black panther (different situation but they were rumored to pass on the mantle before) @han_s0to @diegosa69999573 @bbcgiver9 @richardvdb_ @marvel_updat3s actually, tchalla was meant to die even before chadwick sadly did and this is a good opportunity to have a good female lead, so why recast? recasting a character is not good especially if the original actor actually passed, this whole movie will be a tribute to him @seth02770382 @thisisnice17 @terrellaustin45 @marvel_updat3s what do you mean without chadwick there is no black panther, why should they kill off t'challa because chadwick passed away, why not just recast him which would be no big deal. they did it with hulk, they did it with rhodey so why not with t'challa. @darthmongral @time17prime no  not at all. you honor it by having them celebrate his life in the movie and grieving him with us. the mantle of black panther will of course be passed.  why  and how would a random actor replacing him and giving us a bland story celebrate him at all? @statefromharlem @marvel_updat3s none of them have shown up in the disney marvel story yet. plus the actor playing ross passed away they gotta recast him... like i said, i bet all those characters make it into the plot by the time the movie comes out. the thunderbolts team had a revolving door in the comics @wasteland_dude @marvel_updat3s they can't do the red hulk, the actor passed away earlier this year @humanities_best @_dadmanwalkin @multifandomsssx @marvel_updat3s im not awful if the other people invite what they sow and theres nothing you can do about dyslexia are you educated? that shit just doesnt go away trust me. i only respond the way i do when people are either being dumabass trying to pass it off as facts @bestgamrndawrld @goldensteeler06 @marvel_updat3s william hurt the actor for general ross passed away... they're not going to recast his character lol they didn't recast t'challa when chadwick boseman passed away... @goldensteeler06 @marvel_updat3s the actor sadly passed away. @tewatia7z @calle_lover @wasteland_dude @marvel_updat3s how? the actor for ross passed away @time17prime @marvel_updat3s they could just say the character passed away and val took over leadership or founded the team because of his death @minidrwho @evokerguy @marvel_updat3s *correction, he passed away earlier this year. @minidrwho @evokerguy @marvel_updat3s unfortunately he will likely never become red hulk as his actor william hurt passed away last year. @marvel_updat3s marvel has turned to shit since stan lee passed away. what a shame. @jakeasherboi @marvel_updat3s yep xd i kinda want red hulk but now the actor passed idk if itll still happen @marvel_updat3s seeing as stan lee has passed i think bruce would be a great cameo in every film @licataadam9 @lowkeylokisimp @katelyngay55 @marvel_updat3s chadwick was in his prime as the character and never got to reach full potential in the role because he tragically passed away. recasting him is straight up wrong and disrespectful. instead, coogler and the original cast chose to honour him. if you have a problem, dont watch it @licataadam9 @katelyngay55 @marvel_updat3s okay but you can say that about every character in existence that has a change of actor/pass down mantle, if chadwick was able to do more t'challa films before he passed for example 10 years or so like the other og avengers would you have a problem for a change of mantle then? @bnaturalbiggie @ja_ekk @marvel_updat3s probably wont get to see red hulk since william hurt passed away @cortland_g @mpjgame @time17prime they made that decision without considering anyone else. now they're making a game without t'challa, the comics are pushing out and he's dead when he could've been in a coma. marvel would never honor the legacy of peter parker if a actor passed so what's the difference? @toxicwandastann @gomezinthewoods @wandaspu55y @marvel_updat3s nobody care if you pass, hes already got a film and its probably the best animated film ever released @marvel_updat3s unless a flashback: maria passed away to cancer during the snap/blip. she was also killed off as captain marvel by wanda/scarlet witch. @time17prime honestly... chadwick is black panther. and if you say we should recast him... you clearly don't get what he brought to the table. the legacy of black panther will live on even with shuri at helm. do you recast your parents when they pass on? @expectedreturn @joey_daugherty @kandigirl_3 @koolaidspeaks @marvel_updat3s well iron mans actor didnt pass away unexpectedly and the director felt it would he disrespectful to recast and it happens in the comics so why shouldnt shuri become the black panther? @marvel_updat3s can we just please make the discourse about black panther 2 respectful because marvel movies never seem to get that? especially since the lead actor passed away @sailor_io @time17prime that's a stupid idea, when chadwick passed away a lot of people were asking marvel to cancel bp2 all together.
if you want them to recast t'challa then simply make your voice heard, they didn't kill him why the fuck are you asking people to boycott them "
7,"@xboxpope no don't do that. gimmick people into liking a post because the actor passed away. @xbox i bet you a creative @playstation gamer could make a black panther design look 10 million times better, turn it into exclusive, and your little gimmick picture wouldn't look so cool. @xbox rest in peace my absolute marvel legend and actor in general so sad to see my favorite character and actor in marvel pass away this year is the worst for real.

8,"@vicious696 sadly, im sure they probably will recast black panther. it wouldnt be the first time disney did that when an actor/actress passed away. @chestereugene @thecybercorgi @nullpointer99 @vicious696 @gameovergreggy i am not saying chad created black panther! what the heck. im saying that he has the most effort and time into the character. so if chris evens (god please forbid) passed away you are ok with finding another actor to replace him??? @dam_ilola__ @maliquearrowve1 @therealsupes its still superhero shit, and they would want to watch it because its in honor of a man who passed away that meant a lot to marvel??? i didnt know it was that hard to understand @batmanrobinson @baqer_fox @therealsupes @deadline chadwick's performance was not 'iconic' as you say. he's only become an icon because he passed away in the manner he did &amp; the media, doing what they do, martyred the heck outta him &amp; blew his performance out of proportion. black panther wasn't nearly as epic as people be saying. @mindmaster171 @saimana44583499 @cosmic_marvel @deadline the original actor passed away @therealsupes @slashfilm hold up  it's okay to recast william hurt even tho he's been in the mcu since incredible hulk after he passed away but we can recast black panther cuz it's disrespectful?? make it make sense. @therealsupes @slashfilm marvel flexing their white privilege card i see. of course they're going to recast the white guy and keep his story going. but the black guy who's an idol 2 black people worldwide kill him off. how typical. neither actor who passed away created their respective role. #fmarvel. @fez_97 @therealsupes @slashfilm chadwick died, and marvel retired his character

yet william died and his role got passed on to a new actor breaking: according to @slashfilm, harrison ford will play general thaddeus ""thunderbolt"" ross in marvel's upcoming ""thunderbolts"" film. the character was previously portrayed in the mcu by william hurt, who passed away earlier this year. https://t.co/bnviukinsw @therealsupes so wait didn't shuri possess the mantle ""black panther"" in the comics anyways? had chadwick not pass away he would be the current ""black panther"" (this also looks like the other gaurdian of wakanda he mentioned in the first film. i belive it's sekhmet?) @vicious696 i really think it bad move on marvel, t'challa has so much story left to tell, i think it early to pass on to another character. i get they did out respect because the actor died @5dollacoupon @ronvinke @therealsupes yea what a great tribute to chadwick...recasting his role with the guy who played the villain... how noble lol. don't recast him black panther is actually one that is a mantle that can be passed on @gamingpop_ @therealsupes because it makes 0 sense for her to become the next black panther. if you passed away now it makes a lot more sense for your sister to take up your mantle than  your girlfriend. @dillonosborn11 @trihard_noob_ @theokukyuwa @therealsupes dude it's more of a heir thing, black panther is known to be a title to be passed down the generations and well our original black panther has now passed away, someone has to take the title now and it really doesn't matter if it's male or female. @cosmic_marvel kinda curious on how theyre gonna do thunderbolts when the actor for thunderbolt ross passed @cosmic_marvel what's the point of doing these things after they passed away?
where were you where he was battling cancer and shoot a lot of movies? @deadline so many factual errors in this piece. tell us you only did a cursory wikipedia glance about marvel without actually reading anything from marvel.

thunderbolt ross didn't form the team, and yes, an actor has played him in mcu movies before (william hurt), though sadly, he passed. https://t.co/1ogu0myxej @deadline they should do scream 6 in the future like marvel does.. say 5 - 10yrs have passed and she passed away.. that's how you do that. as long as it's not on screen they can always bring her back or do a pre-scream 6 that happened in those 5-10yr gaps @cosmic_marvel omg stop it was only to honour the director who passed away. he directed the first xmen movie along side jackman @cosmic_marvel homage for richard donner, who passed away today. donner worked with jackman and feige and was feige's mentor during his early career. not everything is speculation"

10,"@jakieboi1 @ign it's weird how black panther's abilities were leaked the day chadwick boseman passed away.  @theslick001 @roundrobinrick @memrys_ @th3marvels @discussingfilm you need to actually watch black panther.  because the story is based entirely around the bp always protecting wakanda. it is 100% on-brand to pass it to the next person. recasting t'challa specifically would be rediculous, contrary to the character, and an insult to the actor. @ign just killing him off without a proper send-off is such a cheap move. i understand he passed away so he couldnt actually die in a movie but they better do something good instead of just saying nah he dead and his sister is black panther now @theslick001 @damleo86 @mcu_direct @marvelstudios black panther is a mantle, and a lineage. i really don't see why they couldn't just let the mantle pass down to successive characters and continue adapting t'challa's stories from the comics with those new characters. if it's going to be a new actor anyway, with a different take. @xdrdeath84 @ign while black panther was a good film i do agree with your point. its sad the guy passed away, but people die every day. dont derail or halt production of something because someone passed away. honor them properly and move on with life. @megabaumtv @dezzymond @duckvalentine @ign how is wakanda forever a guaranteed success? in what universe is a movie where the main character is gone and the actor has passed away a guaranteed success? @ign its only the second movie. i understand he passed away, but dam you all act like this man played in 5 black panther movies. treating it like as if daniel radcliffe died in deathly hallows part 1 type shit. @theslick001 @nocoolnameyet @ign because we didnt see the actor that was devoted to the role pass away. i think black panther shouldnt disappear, i think mbaku should take the mantle over. if youre talking recasting, i think its too late to recast after hes been in 4 movies and a tv show @manutdegy @lukesweenz @gangsterenieb @ign additionally, in order to retain the film rights to spider-man, sony must produce a live action spider-man film every 5 years. if more than 5 years pass without use of the spider-man license, rights will revert to marvel. so any new spider-man film *had* to release by may 2012. @earlinhiding @_princebray_ @youknowme_tdj @fakemxcan @ign you need to get out of your feelings. it's not as though they are recasting a living actor, he passed away. expecting to have things your way is beyond selfish. another actor can do all the things you suggest, not that marvel would have done any of that anyway @ign b+. i liked it. visual, cinematography was incredible. possibly my favorite visual of all marvel movies so far. only thing would be that characters werent relatable and had no emotional impact. but since theyre new characters, i can give that a pass. recommend for big screen @ign and im sure sony will figure out some loopholes like marvel did. seriously, they didnt shy away from thanos, gamora &amp; natasha's deaths, despite being pg-13. how did natasha's death especially,get a pass? i know colored blood is a loophole, but actual blood was flowing all over. @stuartrblack @ign he's the actor who played black panther in the marvel movies and passed away last year sadly @maadaboutyou @ign problem is unlike dumbledore black panther isnt one person but a passed down title. so rather t'challa or the actor playing him died there was always someone who will take the bp name after."

i am grieving as much as all of you.
i loved chadwick boseman as king tchalla as much as all of you. seeing him pass away like that felt like he vanished from all of us. but his memory will live on.
the king lives in all of us. wakanda forever! 
 https://t.co/oumtt1inqh @chadwickboseman to everyone.
forgive me, but this is exactly how i felt seeing him pass away like that. it feels like he just vanished and left this earth after seeing this.
he was the best black panther we have ever seen, and seeing him gone is like seeing him vanish.
wakanda forever. https://t.co/6p2vusoioo @borketernal well the woke flacks at disney are destroying marvel and star wars. need more proof top gun is about to pass the new doctor strange at the box office as the #1 grossing film worldwide. @pha831ntom @avengerhater @playavengers actually, fortnite did it a few months later. the bundle with the black panther skin was scheduled to come out, but he passed shortly before it was meant to release so they gave it some time out of respect and released it along with the challenges as a tribute. @slade_jase @borketernal @__dv8__ @playavengers keep shilling for the million dollar company literally profiting off an actors death. imagine if rdj passed and then marvel released all new rdj ironman inspired toys, merch, and games, that's disgusting and that's what happened here @rengsayeed2 @slade_jase @__dv8__ @playavengers chadwick played black panther, he is not really black panther but he is the actor. he took on that role just like rdj did for ironman. imagine if rdj passed away and square sold all the ironman armors from his films. zero respect @rainfal69702591 @hwyd3 @playavengers the mantle may pass on to shuri. 
in hindsight, tchalla did kinda had a major story arc. 

-civil war (fathers death &amp; defeating zemo)
-black panther
-infinity war (helping the avengers against thanos)
-endgame (bringing the wakandan armies in the final fight)"

it would be nice to have something to give a shit for. @sting i would quite literally pass away haha. so awesome!  hope to see you in cleveland my dude!!! @mejat32 will pass iron man 3, f8, incredibles 2 by thu and beauty and the beast, frozen, jw fallen kingdom, tlj, hp deathly follows 2, black panther by sun. marvelous ! @abs0lutezero @paulbai09507894 @fb_gameover @userofintellect @ceoadam @pubg @fortnitegame so is it getting passed to the customer (ew) or onto amc, whose in debt and this will cost even more money? its not like its hard to pack theaters for a marvel premiere so how is this not just costing more money? @mark5_o youre right that *steve rogers* is more than just a title, but marvel stripped away the suit/shield and we saw who steve rogers was.

the way i see it, the ancient one was once sorcerer supreme. pass the title along to steven strange, its still the ancient one. just title-less."
15,"@kidnoble you tell them the actor who played black panther has passed away but black panther lives on. @kidnoble mine are 17&amp;15,i just told them that chadwick boseman passed away from cancer that he had been battling for 4 years. they both cried. they know he was just an actor playing a character. but when they started crying, i knew. to them he was black panther! @kidnoble honestly. i told my children last night that the actor who played black panther had passed away due complications from a disease he was fighting for years of colon cancer. @kidnoble black panther lives but a bright and beautiful young man who lived with grace and humility, who lived honestly and sincerely has passed away much too soon. the blessing is the life chad lived while he was here and that he achieved a certain kind of immortality through his art. @kidnoble told my sons (12 and 9) this morning. told them the actor who played black panther (and jackie robinson, they watched that too) passed away. mentioned the amount of movies he filmed after his diagnosis and how brave and inspiring he was @kidnoble it was very hard. i told my son that he had passed away, we talked about cancer. about what an icon and gift he was, especially to people of color. we talked about representation, and then we watched black panther for the 30th time and i wept. @nikiya_simpson @kidnoble if you do say anything tell him the incredible actor who played black panther in the movie sadly passed away.  but black panther is a character that has been around for many years and will be for many more. wakanda foreverr!  @kidnoble tchalla passed away but the mantle and spirit of the black panther always lives on. just as he took over for tchaka there will always be a black panther. perhaps shuri? i think this is the best way to break the news. its devasting but also gives hope at the same times.  @kidnoble i told him that the actor passed away due to cancer and he was in shock, because he knew he was younger than me. in regards to very little ones, i would share the quote about death is not the end. and maybe watch black panther to celebrate his legacy. @kidnoble you tell them the actor passed away but left behind the legacy of the black panther. @kidnoble the truth works best: the actor who portrayed the part of black panther, passed away after a long illness. let's watch that amazing film again, together, to honor him.  @kidnoble black panther is not real. tell them a great man named chadwick boseman passed away. t'challa lives on. (it won't be the same tho) @kidnoble i told both my girls (14 and 7) chadwick bozeman, the actor who gave us king tchalla/black panther, passed away from cancer. he was a beautiful person &amp; gave us amazing movies all while he suffered &amp; we didnt even know. my girls were sad. @kidnoble you don't. you tell them an accomplished actor who played jackie robinson, james brown, thurgood marshall,thoth (if you don't know who that is find out pls) &amp; black panther passed away. gives them a chance to learn about those other black men he portrayed &amp; lessens the pain a lil @kidnoble i told him the guy who played black panther passed away. he almost let out an ""oh shit"". he's experienced enough death first hand in his 12 short years here. he knows what's up. @kidnoble you dont. you can tell him that the magnificant actor who played him has sadly passed away. the black panther lives on, as does chadwicks memory. @kidnoble i explained to my son that the actor that portrayed black panther passed away from a terrible disease and that it may mean that tchalla wont be back in the marvel movies. he was really sad but went and put his little costume on. we will watch the movie later. @kidnoble @korifeener black panther was played by an actor who got very sick and passed away. @kidnoble t'challa may have passed, but black panther lives on. #wakandaforever
""in my culture, death is more of a jumping off point"".
rest in power chadwick boseman. @kidnoble black panther lives!!!! only the actor who played him passed on to glory. bp lives on through all of us who embody the ethos and spirit! @kidnoble you dont, my god! #blackpanther is forever! only the actor has passed; his work is immortal. #chadwickboseman @kidnoble re-watch the part where t'challa drinks the black herb and visits his dead father. these things happen. as they show in the film, we all cross over and yet the mantle of black panther is passed on, perhaps to his queen, general, or sister? @kidnoble tell them the truth: a great actor died, but black panther lives on.  another person of color can inherit the symbol to carry on the tradition. 

the torch of excellence and hope must always be passed, any even the child themselves can be that symbol. @kidnoble you don't, the actor passed, but the black panther still lives on. @kidnoble you dont. black panther is very much alive everytime you watch the film. the very talented actor passed and that is sad."
16,"@raisehell1996 @realscreengeek @danielrpk shuri is the best choice because in the comic books when tchalla passed away she became the black panther shes also best qualified considering as of now she is the smartest human on the entire planet not to mention she is the only sibling to the late king. https://t.co/ymnxmpvn1a @marvel_shots whos playing red hulk? yall forgot the actor passed right.. &amp; bucky is in cap 4 soon white wolf.. so maybe titania and absorbing man.. @danielrpk from what i've gathered.
it was supposed to be captain marvel, but people hated her.
then they were gonna push for black panther, but chadwick passed away.

because of the franchise of films building up to it.

why did aquaman do so well?

same reason.

notice dceu box office fell off a cliff once snyder was gone and aquaman (last film closely related to og dceu) had passed.

23,"@buckmeistercul those are different iterations/interpretations of the character though. not quite the same.

if wakanda forever existed outside of the mcu and had a whole new cast, sure! but that's not the case.

also previous batmen did not tragically pass away, so... just feels different to me @buckmeistercul @rae_merrick @m0nieverse boseman passed away and disney and/or marvel decided retiring his character was the best way to honor him. that should be the end of the discussion @rae_merrick @m0nieverse wakanda forever was already in production when chadwick passed away. that was two years ago at this point, or at least coming up on that. how much longer did you expect them to wait? @itswinsomegrace (2/?) i know the character means a lot to people in terms of culture, but the man who played that character passed away, and that should mean more to people. recasting black panther doesnt continue his legacy, it takes it and slaps it onto someone else. it sounds like- @drawnmcu @adonis21871070 @taeoct6 @itswinsomegrace yea but we are in the middle of tchalla arc tho just having someone else take the mantle and shelf tchalla is not doing any favors to the legacy. just recast him finish his arc up and then you can pass the mantle if it's too much @jptuesday marvel said they wont #recasttchalla because he passed away and its disrespectful to chadwick to get recasted as soon as he died. these actors didnt die. so this is a completely different argument. @adonis21871070 @hassanmilikin @skxv4 @jptuesday wtf? marvel announced the decision months after chadwick passed away?? @adonis21871070 @duxsins @jptuesday seeing as comic book characters pass the mantle all the time and marvel will struggle to find another actor as invested as chadwick its the best solution."

35,"@guy_lnd yay this black panther, tom holland didnt pass away. batman and superman recasts have all been in different universe, not to mention different companies. also im sorry if u want to hear it or not, batman and superman are a little bit bigger of characters than tchalla @guy_lnd a simple google search can tell you over 15 people have been black panther at some point in the comics my guy. if they wanted to, they could pass on his mantle to another black actor without replacing t'challa. there are more black panther stories out there to tell @guy_lnd @darklight323 @_assisteagora @nativebrony_91 its a respect thing. i'd feel the same if any other major actor passed while playing their roles. marvel has plenty of people in the comics who have filled those roles and i'd love for them to explore those before re-casting a well established actor. @n3ock1 @nativebrony_91 @darklight323 hate to say this man but the actor of black panther passed away years ago. i think they didn't cast another actor out of respect or pissing the community. @darklight323 @_assisteagora @nativebrony_91 1. chadwick passed away.
2. black panther is a title, not a person. @msemon89 @darklight323 @_assisteagora @nativebrony_91 black panther did not pass away. you just have a juvenile inability to separate fiction from reality. black panther is fine in the mcu. marvel made a poor decision not to #recasttchalla. your failure to grasp the importance of tchalla is not us making up things to complain about @darklight323 @_assisteagora @nativebrony_91 they literally talked about how it's an honor given to the ruler of wakanda in the first movie. thats how kilmonger also became one. since the black panther we know passed away, that means it'll be passed on to their new ruler. quit looking for something to complain about man."

guardians of the galaxy 3 is about the only mcu project on the horizon that im interested in. @littleorpan @adambarnhardt odin was never portrayed as a joke in marvel.
the only time he was jokey in a mcu movie was when loki was pretending to be odin...
the second odin passed away in ragnarok, thanos began attacking and gathering the infinity stones.
zeus all this time has been zeus on olympus. @desert_starr_57 so this was marvels birds of prey movie then? where they try to make a girl power film by making every male character into a slob, a villain, or just a plain old jerk?

black panther is literally established as something that passes from person to person. 

in fact, out of all of the marvel superheroes, the black panther role is probably the most fitting to pass to a new actor. @briannawu i do not envy the writers of black panther 2,  his character was just getting started and had so many stories to tell. id hate to see his legacy end, i say pass it to shuri since she is the most recent black panther in the comics, and people goddamn loved her in the first film"

386,@samierhusain @keywatkins51299 not a valid example because this movie was not conceived to be this. the whole script was done with tchalla as the lead and when he passed the film only got delayed 3 months which was the time they had to write him out

1062,@sentios but why is the expectation that it will discredit his work? wouldn't it be apart of the og actors legacy that the role be passed down? i don't think marvel will miss with who they select. and it's not a request for an immediate recast but to not kill t'challa in bp 2.
1063,"@chipfranklin my dad was a huge football fan and loved john madden. he passed on the love of both to me. we'd laugh together over madden's thanksgiving broadcast, and my dad would marvel over madden's bus. i've missed my dad for a few years now, and another link is now gone. rip, john."

1066,"@morshyyyy yes stan lee. he is the epitome of marvel from writing for the comics, to being involved with the production of the mcu including a cameo in each of the movies. he sadly passed away a few years ago but his birthday wouldve been today "

1068,@rinicku1ous the thing is morbius had his own comic too and they are counting on the marvel brand to carry them really. sony are lucky bastards to have bought the spider-man film rights in the 90s when everybody else passed on it.
1069,"@atheismisawful it formed because some marvel employees dared to be women and get some milkshakes to honor a longtime legend that passed away. seriously, thats all it took for those weirdos to lose their shit. its pathetic."

1073,@rashaabharris raimi would need to write the script with someone else and pass the torch himself to another director. raimi should not be the one handling a miles morales film. just like black panther should not be directed by a white director. obviously its raimiverse so he would help.

1076,@revivemilestone i feel like we wouldve moved more into that had he not passed away. i felt we were gonna go into what kind of king he will be. yall do make great points tho and its hard to argue against it. i just feel like marvel likes to slow burn and sometimes we jump the gun.

1081,@fasterthnlight7 i'm quite familiar with the difference. black panther is the mantle; t'challa is the character. but tell me: how many major comic book stories adapted to film do you know of where the mantle has been passed on after only 1 major film about the main character?? quickly.
1082,"@vialovefan yes. lots of tchalla stories to be told. we've gotten many superman batman and spiderman actors, why are we only limited to 1 black panther? just because he passed away? it's a tragedy for sure but young black kids deserve representation"

1099,@realroyschwartz i think theres a lot of precedent for there to be a new holder of the mantle black panther as opposed to re-casting tchalla. its one of marvels few characters that acknowledges legacy and that the position can be passed down. and thats an interesting story. #wdyt?

1103,@btechluke this!! its truly an opportunity marvel shouldnt pass up. charlie cox as matt mudock is a fan favorite (so is jon bernthal as frank castle!) and the actor being so willing to continue playing him is what shouldve pushed marvel to bring him to the main franchise even sooner.

1116,@stevebuckyrites imo they had too much time pass. the snap has some horrific implications that are not being dealt with properly and probably can't in a marvel movie. how many babies dies because both parents were snapped away? children being raised by other people and then their parents return?

1195,"@truthsandlies14 my grandfather would be me 3 comics a week, every thursday as long as i got good grades, from the time i was 4 until he passed away when i was 15. i always bought marvel. there are a lot of stories to tell and it's complicated. mcu tells those stories well in short bursts."
1196,"marvel will not do any more stan lee cameos

'their policy is he doesn't cameo now that he's passed away""

1198,@techdeals_16 once infinity war and end game released it was pretty much the end of marvel for me. after stan lee passed away it seemed the movies lost good direction.
1199,"@coyjandreau btw...i always post, always buy physical media...but when a killer deal comes along, hard to pass up (no guarantee black friday will have this kind of deal!)
on vudu...every marvel mcu film in 4k is on sale for $7.99 each(!!), &amp; looks like each of them has the bonus features!!"
1200,"@seauxheauxy i was a knucklehead before and never wanted to do it. finally manned up after chadwick boseman passed away. told my doctor i wanted it done and he said ""why because of the black panther?"" switched to a new primary care dr and got it done. test came back with no signs of it"
1201,"@sando_ni_cairo omg mhie what a throwback  to be fair, marvel din ang spider-man. baka naman theyre doing an oldschool tribute thing "
1202,"@giselefetterman my best friend of almost 30 years passed away 3 weeks ago. i just saw my first marvel movie without him and cried, unashamed, the whole damn movie.  people stared. oh well!"
1203,"marvel's policy states that stan lee won't have any more cameos since he's passed away

'the simpsons' tried to use his old cameo audio for 'the good, the bart, and the loki' but got rejected

1204,"@anasitani1 similar to murtaugh's
 in lethal weapon
directed by richard donner
who passed away today
who worked with kevin feige,actual president of marvel,
 as producers of x-men 
starring jackman
it all connects ! https://t.co/v8znb8xnkl"
1205,"@droyale facts im lost in da sauce too, but i walk away. i have to.. for days. cause when im here im stuck.. i really just marvel at stupidity of the intellectualish opinions in here.  i be amazed.. then i look up three hrs done passed"
1206,@canyonmoonblu i have now passed away
1207,"@qijius well, this project was initially announced prior to his death. now that it's come to pass, i assume they'll write in someone else taking up the mantle of the black panther. time will tell whether it's tasteful or not."
1208,"@thespoilist its a weird one. you can still acknowledge the actors significance and impact and recast. every marvel character will be played by someone else eventually. but its built into the character that its a mantle that gets passed on, guess thatll happen down the line."
1209,@fejimanz you just passed me in a single day. great. i'm still back on winter soldier. taking a two film marvel detour certainly didn't help.
1210,not caught up on the podcast so sorry if you already covered this but i need to know how stoked you are for marvels eternals @theemschulz  im going to pass away
1211,@kirsten655321 ya bb was given away for free at a maine coon adoption center bc no one would take her! her brother was a maine coon who pass away in the texas freeze  : ( no one would take her! so i did! she is literally a black panther in my lviing room!
1212,"@comicsinthega if i remember correctly, he was supposed to do a new captain marvel book but it didnt pan out and then he passed away. i dont know if it wouldve been jerry ordways power of shazam or if it had been another book altogether. shame really as his art really suited."
1213,"@renzy_dee if he takes bond, it is a cultural milestone. if he takes black panther, her replaces a beloved actor that passed far too soon. there is a huge upside to bond. i think following chadwick will be a nightmare."
1214,"@thebatman so the name jim gordon is black origin now? i thought it was italian and british that's why the original character is european heritage, now all of the sudden african? well i gues we can make the black panther played by a european decent since main actor passed."
1215,@leilal0ver if its confirmed im actually gonna cry theres no way harry is in a marvel movie ill just pass away
1216,"@turns1701e i do, therefore id would like a white actor to play black panther, when enough times has passed for the role to be passed on."
1217,@lhhkissrry marvel and harry ?? im gonna pass away
1218,"@fenixammunition wow, marvel is really going down the shitty since stan passed away.  funny, i knew this was gonna happen after that happened."
1219,"@romxnva she's not dead. florence is going to be in more marvel projects - the film's director has basically confirmed yelena is going to be the new black widow. the batons are passed to her.

nat has the vest probably because of a sisterly moment with yelena giving it to her. it's okay."
1220,"@comic_foil while true i personally just find thor, iron man and captain marvel to be worth the 1st watch, but after that i'd pass on a rewatch. personally, while i love the big scope of the mcu, they do need to work as a standalone film as well."
1221,@summersfrosts the 2nd ones more infamous tweet is probably how they wrote an essay about the social economic impact of civil war on society for their marvel class that got passed around as a copypaste but turns out there are classes about marvel in some schools so it might have been true
1222,"@dunsfordmage hi colin, it was the last film in the season, black panther, that we didn't get to screen. there aren't any plans to screen it at the moment but i'll pass on your request :)"
1223,"@tylersigman the marvel ttrpg im writing was announced friday morning. my mother-in-law passed away in our home (as planned with hospice) on friday evening. and my quadruplets had their 19th birthday on saturday. 

it was a lot to fit into a weekend."
1224,"@jakemurfx marvel krub , about endgame it's hurt when ironman pass away"
1225,@punchdrunkking continuity in marvel was never the same when mark passed away. he always kept it in check. rest in peace
1226,@sobertdeniro u might be thinking black panther. he passed away
1227,"@shempmeister no one smokes. the story goes that quesadas father passed away from lung cancer, so he banned smoking in marvel comics. heroes, villains, everyone. all because of his personal feelings on the matter."
1228,@iamjenbt my wife got me the black panther after chadwick passed away
1229,@skylershuler there has been one black panther movie.  what are you talking about.  you don't know what direction it may have went if chad didn't pass away.
1230,"@winterjedii you all are all wrong. my vote is for black panther, the character is still living even though the the actor has passed away (rip). yet you all, why does it have to have a leader and not a committee of peers who work together. hulk, black panther, ca sam, dr strange, cpt marvel"
1231,@jowrotethis at this point marvel would have to deliberately make a bad film for this to suck and even then it would still end up being way better then what wb tries to pass off as their superhero films.
1232,"hey guys samantha here, i had a family member pass away today and i dont know if im going to be active, ill probably tweet something later but um @crueibummer (co-owner) will post a few simple gain tweets."
1233,"@stuntman_mik3 love the director's cut and like the tc. in both versions, if you really pass the playground scene, this movie is really awesome

colin farrell is just amazing as bullseye and i think this is the first time there is a post credit scene in a marvel related film?"
1234,@anothermarvelg what are the odds on they wont pass the black panther mantle in the next film?  i actually think they might wait to commit on this.
1235,"@vfxjimin it's not the tower of terror anymore. they redid it a couple years back to be guardians of the galaxy themed. while the other members would enjoy it cuz they're marvel fanboys, i just know hobi would pass away (respectfully)"
1236,"@formulaline same, it's still so weird, watching movies with him in it. just as weird when there are other actors who quite recently passed away in movies  but with black panther i could've prepared myself, i didn't expect to see him in this movie "
1237,"mail call!

i'm very excited about this group of new comics that came in today. it's taking all my effort not to rip open orphan and the 5 beasts right now. i already have the woman of marvel, but couldn't pass up that @thewolfmaria cover.

also, free siktc is a nice touch. https://t.co/a8u44dimxi"
1238,"@m_cannon313 they always show stan lee in the marvel movies, give him some cameo of sorts.... he's since passed away, but they put his face on that magazine to the right."
1239,wow this can pass as a marvel superhero short film.. i'm in awe @txt_members https://t.co/ndje23yijc
1240,"@bob_noss also it's all fantasy football right now. let's see what they actually make. for me it's more the peformative notion of getting excited about these directors doing a marvel or dc movie. i'll give regina a pass, long time actor turned directors are a different genre."
1241,@wacksabbath to be fair theres some 45 y/o twinks out there (this argentine prog guy comes to mind he looks really young and cute still so id give him a pass) but no marvel actor #249 is not a twink
